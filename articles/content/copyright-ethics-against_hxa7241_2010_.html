   <h2>Introduction</h2>

   <p id="intro-p1" title="intro-p1">The term &lsquo;moral&rsquo; is quite often used in discussion of copyright and its public use. But an important question is most often overlooked: what is the ethical status of copyright itself? Is copyright, and more generally IP, itself moral?</p>

   <p id="intro-p2" title="intro-p2">This article makes a rational, ethical case against IP in two fairly brief arguments. Broadly, the first is based on groundedness of laws and personal liberty, the second on universalisation and co-operative benefit.</p>

   <p id="intro-p3" title="intro-p3">It should be common knowledge that IP is justifiable solely on a pragmatic base: it proposes only that a particular form of commercial arrangement is useful and practical in some circumstances. IP in itself reflects no principle or intrinsic value &ndash; in fact, the opposite. The following arguments should make clear why that must be so.</p>

   <h4>1. We have liberty</h4>

   <p id="commons-1-p1" title="commons-1-p1"><i>We have fundamental rights to autonomy of our minds and bodies (standard liberalism, from Mill).</i> (Axiom 1)</p>

   <p id="commons-1-p2" title="commons-1-p2"><i>We have fundamental rights to freedom of expression (consistent with Mill's &lsquo;liberty principle&rsquo;).</i> (Axiom 2)</p>

   <p id="commons-1-p3" title="commons-1-p3">These can be taken as uncontroversial: they are fairly standard liberalism from Mill. According to Mill we have unrestricted liberty except to the extent that it injures someone else. This is the idea of the liberty principle &ndash; a basic, fundamental notion of liberal democracies.</p>

   <h4>2. IP laws have a single subject: expressions</h4>

   <p id="commons-2-p1" title="commons-2-p1"><i>All artificial objects intentionally produced are &lsquo;expressions&rsquo; and these are the only subjects of IP laws.</i> (Premise 1)</p>

   <p id="commons-2-p2" title="commons-2-p2">The digital world presents a problem: software is granted both copyrights and patents, yet ordinarily the subjects of patent law and copyright law are mutually exclusive. Either the digital world is a special hybrid thing, or the categories of patent and copyright have been incorrectly drawn.</p>

   <p id="commons-2-p3" title="commons-2-p3">Software reveals the faulty ontology underlying intellectual property law. The only thing distinguishing it from Jacquard looms, steam engines, the telegraph, and smoke signals, is perceptibility of mechanism. It is not a new kind of object, it just works at a different level of sophistication.</p>

   <p id="commons-2-p4" title="commons-2-p4">We can use a single common term to describe the subjects of copyright and patent: they are <i>expressions</i>. Any idea made manifest in the world is the expression of that idea.</p>

   <p id="commons-2-p5" title="commons-2-p5">These expressions can have different purposes &ndash; a description of a water-pump is aesthetic, whereas an actual water-pump is utilitarian &ndash; but all are really the same sort of thing ontologically speaking. There is a spectrum of, on the one side, things that are primarily utilitarian, and on the other, things that are primarily aesthetic. And all of the objects of intellectual property law can be placed somewhere on that spectrum.</p>

   <div class="part" id="commons-3" title="commons-3">
   <h4>3. Ownership is justified by a grounding in brute facts</h4>

   <p id="commons-3-p1" title="commons-3-p1"><i>Rights of ownership stem from brute facts of possession, and laws are &lsquo;just&rsquo; when grounded in brute facts.</i> (Premise 2)</p>

   <p id="commons-3-p2" title="commons-3-p2">There is a world of brute facts that is the pre-institutional world. You can think of the world without any of the legal or social conventions that we now use to understand the world, and understand that, before all of those institutions, there is a world of brute facts.</p>

   <p id="commons-3-p3" title="commons-3-p3">In a world without institutional facts we still have objects and actions. We still occupy space, and have possessions, but we don't have the institutional terms like ownership. In such a pre-institutional world, if someone is holding a book, they are not owning it, but they are possessing it, and excluding others with that act. From these brute facts arise those more formally defined structures.</p>

   <p id="commons-3-p4" title="commons-3-p4">The justice of laws that enable us to exert our rights over land and moveables are grounded in brute facts. Actual possession and indicia of possession give rise to just claims of legal ownership. Exclusivity and the necessity of force or violence for dispossession make claims of legal ownership &lsquo;grounded&rsquo;.</p>

      <li>&lsquo;Apriori Foundations Of Civil Law&rsquo;; Reinach; 1913.</li>
   </ul>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="commons-4" title="commons-4">
   <h4>4. Some things cannot be justly owned</h4>

   <p id="commons-4-p1" title="commons-4-p1"><i>There are parts of the world that cannot be justly owned.</i> (Premise 3)</p>

   <p id="commons-4-p2" title="commons-4-p2">There is no way to exclusively possess an expression <i>type</i> (&ndash; the abstract &lsquo;pattern&rsquo;, as opposed to <i>token</i> &ndash; the concrete instance), nor does reproduction/copying of an expression type once expressed require force or violence. Nor does it impinge upon individual autonomy to do so. If someone comes up to you and rips a picture from your hand, that's a very different act from if someone copies the picture. Unlike land and moveables, IP laws are not &lsquo;grounded&rsquo; in any brute facts of possession.</p>

   <p id="commons-4-p3" title="commons-4-p3">IP law is solely pragmatic: it is to support a particular commercial arrangement proposed as practically beneficial overall.</p>

   <p id="commons-4-p4" title="commons-4-p4"><i>Just</i> laws are grounded in brute facts. The positive law may be <i>unjust</i> if it conflicts with &lsquo;grounded&rsquo; laws. For example, if laws were passed to make private property unlawful, those laws would be unjust. IP is not a &lsquo;natural right&rsquo; nor is it &lsquo;grounded&rsquo;, so a critical inquiry is: are there parts of the world for which the granting of IP rights conflicts with other, grounded, rights? &ndash; and hence where it is unjust.</p>

   <p id="commons-4-p5" title="commons-4-p5">There are two types of commons: &lsquo;commons by choice&rsquo; and &lsquo;commons by necessity&rsquo;. <i>Commons by choice</i> involve parts of the world that could be possessed, but for which we make conscious decisions to keep them in the public domain (for example, national parks, international waters). <i>Commons by necessity</i> are parts of the world that cannot be possessed or enclosed in any meaningful sense. Examples include: all of the oxygen in the atmosphere, bands of the radio spectrum, laws of nature.</p>

   <p id="commons-4-p6" title="commons-4-p6">The human genome, for example, is a constantly evolving object that involves every member of the species, and is a <i>commons by necessity</i>, like outer space, the atmosphere, sunlight, laws of nature, and radio spectra. We have rights in common to these objects. These common rights supersede conscious decisions about how to use them.</p>

   <p id="commons-4-p7" title="commons-4-p7">And this isn't a pragmatic argument: it is distinct from the idea of &lsquo;anti-commons&rsquo;. It is an ontological argument: about the nature of the things themselves.</p>

   <ul>
      <li>&lsquo;Who Owns You&rsquo;; Koepsell; 2009.</li>
   </ul>

<!--(Radio spectra are ambiguous: their interaction with space means they are in practice exclusive - in abstract, radio spectra are non-exclusive, but in any limited volume of space they are.)-->

<!--(Genomes are too 'strong' as an example, they have *two* reasons why they cannot be 'owned': not only are they abstract, but they also have no creator. A counter argument would be: no-one created genomes, but I created my book - that is the difference, and that is why I own my book.)-->

   <div class="part" id="commons-5" title="commons-5">
   <h4>5. IP laws restrict expression and freedom</h4>

   <p id="commons-5-p1" title="commons-5-p1"><i>IP rights are exclusionary rights that prevent the unauthorized expression of protected idea types.</i> (Premise 4)</p>

   <p id="commons-5-p2" title="commons-5-p2">While an author or inventor &lsquo;owns&rsquo; their IP, they can exclude others from making unauthorised reproductions of their expressions. They can receive royalties for any reproduction made. They can enjoin the expression of others of their protected idea types.</p>

   <p id="commons-5-p3" title="commons-5-p3">The law allows some types of restrictions on expression, typically to prevent physical harms or incitement of physical harms &ndash; consistent with Mill's liberty principle. But IP laws are government restrictions on expression having nothing to do with physical harms or incitement.</p>

   <p id="commons-5-p4" title="commons-5-p4">Expressed ideas belong to the category &lsquo;commons by necessity&rsquo;, but IP as a category of law presumes to enclose this. This is an ethical wrong. To &lsquo;own&rsquo; such commons is to demand exclusion of people from these commons by necessity &ndash; to prevent the free use of these ideas. This is immoral because our shared rights to commons by necessity are grounded in the brute facts of their unenclosability. And to attempt such enclosure is to interfere with and curtail our mental and physical autonomy and our freedom of expression &ndash; in contradiction to the initial axioms above.</p>

   <p id="commons-5-p5" title="commons-5-p5">Expressed ideas are non-exclusive and unenclosable. Attempts to enclose them are as morally wrong as attempts to enclose genes, sunlight, oxygen, or any other commons by necessity.</p>

<h3>Copying Argument</h3>

   <h4>Summary</h4>

   <ol>
      <li>IP has particular effective features: about copying and creating.</li>
      <li>Copying is good: essentially costless and amplifying.</li>
      <li>Copying cannot be arranged or transmuted into something else.</li>

   </ol>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="copying-intro" title="copying-intro">
   <h4>Introduction</h4>

   <p id="copying-intro-p1" title="copying-intro-p1">Moral discussion of &lsquo;intellectual property&rsquo; almost always turns to argument of &lsquo;property&rsquo;. But this cannot be the right starting point when abstract objects have such obvious and essential differences to physical objects. Instead, an unprejudiced approach is needed.</p>

   <p id="copying-intro-p2" title="copying-intro-p2">First: morals are taken as a code of co-operation: a particular moral system need not claim to be absolutely good, just co-operatively beneficial &ndash; consistent &ndash; for those who choose it. The underlying notion of universalisation is a principle of almost any normal rational conception of ethics.</p>

   <p id="copying-intro-p3" title="copying-intro-p3">Now: a moral reckoning is based on &lsquo;effective features&rsquo;. We don't evaluate lying, for example, by arguing over derivations of a person's &lsquo;right to control their communication&rsquo;, or some such. We note its practical qualities and see how they universalise: lying may gain an advantage for one person, but universalised it defeats all communication. This follows from the effects it has &ndash; or its &lsquo;effective features&rsquo;. The same kind of evaluation can be done for IP.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="copying-1" title="copying-1">
   <h4>1. IP has particular effective features: about copying and creating</h4>

   <p id="copying-1-p1" title="copying-1-p1">These are the basic elements, prior to any social or legal constructions:</p>

   <ul id="copying-1-p2" title="copying-1-p2">
      <li>Copying
      <ul>
         <li>duplicates, and so increases, its input</li>
         <li>is free in itself (no loss to anyone, no compensation needed)</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Creating
      <ul>
         <li>has no necessary dependence on its copies
            <ul>
            <li>the opposite: it has dependence on previous copies</li>
            </ul></li>
         <li>costs effort, but can be compensated directly</li>
      </ul></li>
   </ul>

   <p id="copying-1-p3" title="copying-1-p3">The main concern is copying. This is what IP regulates and directly affects. But creating is related: really, the two are not distinct &ndash; all creating is to a larger or smaller degree copying.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="copying-2" title="copying-2">
   <h4>2. Copying is good: essentially costless and amplifying</h4>

   <p id="copying-2-p1" title="copying-2-p1">If an abstract object is good, then copying it duplicates and spreads that good. And the essential cost of copying (above making the concrete item) is practically nothing. We can certainly wish this were a general law: if everyone copied freely and widely, we would all benefit &ndash; we would all receive very much more good, and at negligible cost.</p>

   <p id="copying-2-p2" title="copying-2-p2">And because copying and creating are so related they are mutually supportive: assisting one will assist the other too.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="copying-3" title="copying-3">
   <h4>3. Copying cannot be arranged or transmuted into something else</h4>

   <p id="copying-3-p1" title="copying-3-p1">An arrangement that appears to gain from copy restriction does so only by relative incidental circumstance. The advantage is accidental: the benefit of copying is not somehow realised elsewhere, it just disappears.</p>

   <p id="copying-3-p2" title="copying-3-p2">Because nothing can be done to change the element of copying, there is no assembly or arrangement of it that can get more from it than is already there. There is no way to extract its good, or transmute it into another form. The only way to benefit is simply to use it &ndash; and if it is not used, the benefit is lost.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="copying-4" title="copying-4">
   <h4>4. IP restricts copying, so yields an overall loss</h4>

   <p id="copying-4-p1" title="copying-4-p1">Since copying is good and cannot be transmuted into anything else, anything that impedes, diminishes, or counteracts copying will reduce the good available.</p>

   <p id="copying-4-p2" title="copying-4-p2">Paying for copies is like an arrangement where people pay to use their eyesight. There is no gain to be found: eyesight cannot be &lsquo;exchanged&rsquo; for something else, it cannot be redistributed elsewhere. The particular benefit is simply lost.</p>

   <p id="copying-4-p3" title="copying-4-p3">A copy-restrictive arrangement is only good so far as it emulates or approximates to a free-sharing arrangement, thereby gaining its benefit. So the best possible copy-restrictive arrangement is none at all.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="copying-5" title="copying-5">
   <h4>5. Absolutist IP is morally inconsistent</h4>

   <p id="copying-5-p1" title="copying-5-p1">With absolutist IP, if everyone is a creator, there is no general gain and instead a net loss &ndash; all payments for copies cancel out, leaving only an extra bureaucratic cost. It is a worse choice than a free-sharing system, and it would be senseless for any to choose it. Alternatively, if only some are creators, their extra gain depends on the others' extra payment/loss &ndash; it is not a consistent co-operative system, i.e. not moral, and it would be senseless for all to choose it.</p>

   <p id="copying-5-p2" title="copying-5-p2">The latter, however, may be the reason for support for absolutist IP. The supporters unconsciously assume they are on the winners side &ndash; that they gain more as a particular individual than they lose as a member of the community. They will a rule for all, but make an exception of themselves. There can be differences in creative achievement in a free-sharing system too, but any willing of an absolutist IP system wills a comparative loss for all. So one could only will it if it also brought a personal gain larger than the general loss.</p>

   <p id="copying-5-p3" title="copying-5-p3">The only way absolutist IP can make sense is as an <i>immoral</i> intention.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="copying-illus" title="copying-illus">
   <h4>Illustration</h4>

   <p id="copying-illus-p1" title="copying-illus-p1">The absolutist IP position claims justification derived philosophically from well-founded notions of &lsquo;property&rsquo; and &lsquo;ownership&rsquo;. But the <i>effect</i> is restriction of <i>copying</i> and its simple, immediate, intrinsic good. Compare the limit case of this with free-sharing to bring the essentials into sharp relief:</p>

   <p id="copying-illus-p2" title="copying-illus-p2">Either: with free copying/sharing, we all greatly magnify our access to good stuff, at no cost to anyone. In a group of 100, if each of us makes some music, everyone has 100 pieces of music to listen to.</p>

   <p id="copying-illus-p3" title="copying-illus-p3">Or: with absolutist IP, we all keep our own stuff (our own <i>property</i>) to ourselves, and so we all have much less stuff available to us. If each of us makes some music, everyone has only one piece of music to listen to. But there is a compensation. Perhaps it offers a theoretical argument telling us we are doing the right thing!</p>

   <p id="copying-illus-p4" title="copying-illus-p4">It is not a difficult choice. It is a matter of effect: absolutist IP takes something away from all but gives nothing new in return.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="copying-conclusion" title="copying-conclusion">
   <h4>Conclusion</h4>

   <p id="copying-conclusion-p1" title="copying-conclusion-p1">Abstracts can be copied, and copying <i>adds</i>. This is like a free natural resource, from which all can draw, and no-one loses. A copy-restrictive ethos throws this away to some greater or lesser degree, and with no necessity to. (It may sometimes appear to exchange this resource for something else, but really it can only give something we already have.)</p>

   <p id="copying-conclusion-p2" title="copying-conclusion-p2">Anything done by impeding copies &ndash; e.g. an IP structure &ndash; can be done without impeding copies. Since free-copying is good, and impeding it is unnecessary, impeding it &ndash; like IP &ndash; is obviously bad. IP, assessed by its effective features, fails, at least relatively, the moral principle of universalisation.</p>

   <p id="copying-conclusion-p3" title="copying-conclusion-p3">It is not possible to say a priori what particular structures of organisation or commerce are efficient, but it is possible to say the general form should be free-sharing rather than copy-restricting.</p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<div class="section" id="internal-conflict" title="internal-conflict">
<h3>Appendix 1: The internal conflict in IP &lsquo;ownership&rsquo;</h3>

   <p><i>(This is not fully explored, but might be worth further consideration.)</i></p>


   <p id="internal-conflict-p1" title="internal-conflict-p1">At the very root of the absolutist IP position there appears to be a confusion.</p>

   <p id="internal-conflict-p2" title="internal-conflict-p2">When claiming &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; they claim the pure abstract alone. They say the content, the pattern, the idea, is theirs &ndash; and this claim must necessarily separate itself from the material instance. But then, when talking about other people's copies, they want to claim ownership and control over the <i>instances</i> of the abstract. They say you cannot have <i>that copy</i>.</p>

   <p id="internal-conflict-p3" title="internal-conflict-p3">First they are saying their ownership has nothing to do with material instance, then they are saying it does. This single claim of &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; is actually for two mutually exclusive things.</p>

   <p id="internal-conflict-p4" title="internal-conflict-p4">The whole matter hinges on the single point at which the claim of &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; is made, and what is claimed. The concepts of abstract and concrete are mutually exclusive, so when claiming ownership of one can you at the same time be claiming the other?</p>

   <p id="internal-conflict-p5" title="internal-conflict-p5">If you want to claim an abstract based on being its creator, then the claim can have no connection to any concrete instances. If you want to claim any control over the instances, it must be a separate claim. But then it cannot derive justification from anything to do with the abstract and its creator. If you want some kind of combination or interaction of the two, you need two separate justifications &ndash; being the creator, alone, is insufficient. Otherwise, there must be a contradiction.</p>

   <p id="internal-conflict-p6" title="internal-conflict-p6">The absolutist concept of IP is clearly not about ownership or property in any normal sense. It is some strange concoction that must conflict with normal ownership and property. There is some kind of conceptual mismatch. The normal idea of property and ownership for physical objects has been forced upon abstract objects, like a square peg into a round hole.</p>

   <h4>1. Communication is profoundly important</h4>

   <p id="communication-1-p1" title="communication-1-p1">&lsquo;Freedom of speech&rsquo; or &lsquo;freedom of expression&rsquo; is widely recognised throughout history as deserving high value and regard. It is effectively synonymous (often explicitly so) with freedom of communication, and closely related to freedom of thought (as <i>what</i> to express). Communication can be viewed as just the global perspective on expression.</p>

   <p id="communication-1-p2" title="communication-1-p2">We value it highly because it is pre-eminent in our biological, evolutionary identity.</p>

   <p id="communication-1-p3" title="communication-1-p3">At the core of being human is language &ndash; that is: expression and communication. The whole of human progress and civilisation rests on the facility with which we communicate. It is the cornerstone of co-operation: each individual can gain the experience and knowledge of all &ndash; an immense multiplication of intelligence.</p>

   <p id="communication-1-p4" title="communication-1-p4">The bedrock of culture, organisation, and progress is communication, and the essence of communication is its richness and free flow.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="communication-2" title="communication-2">
   <h4>2. All abstract content is the subject of communication</h4>

   <p id="communication-2-p1" title="communication-2-p1">&lsquo;Freedom of expression&rsquo; is commonly defined very broadly: it is not limited to particular subjects, or media, or to marginal opinions, or to a person's own new ideas. Digital objects and the internet are just a new means or medium &ndash; now, anything that can be digitised can be communicated.</p>

   <p id="communication-2-p2" title="communication-2-p2">Does entertainment count? and simple copying? &ndash; is sharing a music file subject to this consideration? We cannot cleanly separate entertainment from knowledge or information or anything else. Each most likely has at least a piece of others. It is obviously communication in the simple sense: a transfer of mental state/experience, and so in a larger sense it takes part in our overall mental life.</p>

   <p id="communication-2-p3" title="communication-2-p3">Ultimately, it is not the type of abstract that matters: if we deem the item good, then we must deem its communication even better. We want communication because of its general form: it amplifies good &ndash; however we define it.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="communication-3" title="communication-3">
   <h4>3. Copyright is not necessary</h4>

   <p id="communication-3-p1" title="communication-3-p1">Copyright is a practical commercial arrangement that binds copies to their original creation in a special way. It makes the creation dependent (speculatively) on the copies: the copies are intended to pay for the creation.</p>

   <p id="communication-3-p2" title="communication-3-p2">But there is no necessity for this dependency in these elements. In fact, the opposite is true: the copies are dependent on the creation. It is perfectly possible to have a practical arrangement where creations are made with no regard to copies (and such do indeed exist). Creators can be paid by other ways than copy monopoly.</p>

   <p id="communication-3-p3" title="communication-3-p3">Also, it is worth noting, in a population of many creations and copies, the two notions are not entirely distinct: creations are partly copies, and copies are partly creations. This means they are both positively related: any system that helps or hinders one will help or hinder the other.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="communication-4" title="communication-4">
   <h4>4. Copyright substantially obstructs communication</h4>

   <p id="communication-4-p1" title="communication-4-p1">Copyright sets rules on who is allowed to copy what. For each communicable item, only the &lsquo;owner&rsquo; has or can give authority to copy it freely.</p>

   <p id="communication-4-p2" title="communication-4-p2">So people are no longer free to communicate; they must do so only within set restrictions, and according to the control of someone else. The limits imposed are very substantial, and only in small ways are items permitted to be copied, adapted, or reused &ndash; in general: communicated &ndash; freely.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="communication-5" title="communication-5">
   <h4>5. So copyright must be overruled by communication freedom</h4>

   <p id="communication-5-p1" title="communication-5-p1">By copyright, something natural and pre-eminently important is very substantially constrained by rules that are not necessary. Since copyright impedes something considered moral, it must be to that extent immoral.</p>

   <p id="communication-5-p2" title="communication-5-p2">Such immorality is not merely academic; it translates to impracticality. There will be many people who, despite whatever &lsquo;justification&rsquo; authority promulgates, will simply follow their natural inclination to communicate. And with the internet, this has negligible cost and significant benefit.</p>

   <p id="communication-5-p3" title="communication-5-p3">When we have an improved way to do something beneficial, we should arrange commerce to suit that, not the other way around.</p>
