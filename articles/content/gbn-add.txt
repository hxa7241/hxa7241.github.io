-------

what are the higher-level execution abstractions/structure?
	decentralization, multiplicity, iteration, emergence

semi-digital, separate fixations, scaffold, complex aggregated physical interface

parameterised objects (like c++ templates) - mostly same but with a variable part
	amino acid, nucleotide




physical packaging
------------------

chromosome duplicates in packaging...




execution
---------

how does genome addressing work?

where is the codon key-value association stored?




replication
-----------

initiation
elongation
termination


replication begins at the same multiple points along the DNA
origins of replication
20000, 1 per 150Kb
particular sub-sequences, unclear
certain proteins attach in the locality, separates nucleotide pairs
other proteins attach and continue separating, preparing for elongation

both directions from initiation poin


cell cycle
	mitosis M phase - cell division
	gap G1 phase - execution and other cellular activity
	synthesis S phase - genome replication
	gap G2 phase - execution and other cellular activity
