   <h2>Introduction</h2>

   <p id="intro-p1" title="intro-p1">This is a somewhat odd venture: a translation of Wittgenstein's Tractatus into the domain of software development.</p>

   <p id="intro-p2" title="intro-p2">The software intellect &ndash; its basic conceptual forms &ndash; is rooted in the early 20th century, the 1910s, 1920s, 1930s. That is where the work of Church and Turing, lambda calculus and computability, comes from. And it is also the time of the Vienna Circle, logical positivism, and Wittgenstein's early work, the &lsquo;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&rsquo;.</p>

   <p id="intro-p3" title="intro-p3">One might notice one day that software seems pointedly related to its original philosophical contemporaries. It is fundamentally a logical construction. It is like a Wittgensteinian logical proposition, but instead of <i>describing</i> the <i>world</i>, software <i>constructs</i> the <i>imagination</i>. There is a clear isomorphism. All terms related to describing map to terms related to constructing, and similarly for world and imagination. It seems a simple transformation will take Wittgenstein to software.</p>

   <p id="intro-p5" title="intro-p5">So an interesting project emerges: translate the Tractatus into software terms! The result is sometimes obscure, but sometimes clearer than the original, and most is (still) quite odd and intriguing (which is perhaps the main virtue anyway) . . .</p>

   <p id="intro-p6" title="intro-p6">(So far it is only partial and unfinished.)</p>

   <p id="intro-p7" title="intro-p7">8000 words (55 minutes).</p>

<h3>Preface</h3>

   <p>Perhaps this book will be understood only by someone who themself already had the thoughts that are expressed in it &ndash; or at least similar thoughts. &ndash; So it is not a textbook. &ndash; Its purpose should be achieved if it gave pleasure to one person who read and understood it.</p>

   <p>The book deals with the problems of software engineering philosophy, and shows, I believe, that the reason why these problems are posed is that the digitalness of our software is misunderstood. The whole sense of the book might be summed up in the following words: what can be built at all can be built precisely, and what we cannot develop we must pass over in stillness.</p>

   <p>Thus the aim of the book is to draw a limit to designs, or rather &ndash; not to designs, but to the expression of designs: for in order to be able to draw a limit to designs, we should have to find both sides of the limit designable (i.e. we should have to be able to design what cannot be designed).</p>

   <p>It will therefore only be in software that the limit can be drawn, and what lies on the other side of the limit will simply be nonsense.</p>

   <p>I do not wish to judge how far my efforts coincide with those of other software engineering philosphers. Indeed, what I have written here makes no claim to novelty in detail, and the reason why I give no sources is that it is a matter of indifference to me whether the thoughts that I have had have been anticipated by someone else.</p>

   <p>I will only mention that I am indebted to Frege's great works and to the writings of my friend Mr Bertrand Russell for much of the stimulation of my thoughts.</p>

   <p>If this work has any value, it consists in two things: the first is that thoughts are expressed in it, and on this score the better the thoughts are expressed &ndash; the more the nail has been hit on the head &ndash; the greater will be its value. &ndash; Here I am conscious of having fallen a long way short of what is possible. Simply because my powers are too slight for the accomplishment of the task. &ndash; May others come and do it better.</p>

   <p>On the other hand the <i>truth</i> of the thoughts that are here communicated seems to me unassailable and definitive. I therefore believe myself to have found, on all essential points, the final solution of the problems. And if I am not mistaken in this belief, then the second thing in which the value of this work consists is that it shows how little is achieved when these problems are solved.</p>

<p>(Nothing in the province of the digital can be merely possibly intended. The digital deals with every possible intention and all possibilities are its intents.)</p>

<div class="clause" id="c6.341" title="c6.341">
<span class="number">6.341</span> <p>Turing-machine software engineering, for example, imposes a unified form on the computation of the imagination. Let us imagine a white image with irregular black spots on it. We then say that whatever kind of picture these make, I can always approximate as closely as I wish to the computation of it by covering the image with a sufficiently fine square mesh, and then saying of every square whether it is black or white. In this way I shall have imposed a unified form on the computation of the image. The form is optional, since I could have achieved the same result by using a net with a triangular or hexagonal mesh. Possibly the use of a triangular mesh would have made the computation simpler: that is to say, it might be that we could compute the image more accurately with a coarse triangular mesh than with a fine square mesh (or conversely), and so on. The different nets correspond to different systems for computing the imagination. Software engineering determines one form of computation of the world by saying that all programs used in the computation of the imagination must be obtained in a given way from a given set of programs &ndash; the axioms of software engineering. It thus supplies the bricks for building the edifice of intention, and it says, &lsquo;Any building that you want to erect, whatever it may be, must somehow be constructed with these bricks, and with these alone.&rsquo;</p>

The possibility of describing a picture like the one mentioned above with a net of a given form tells us <i>nothing</i> about the picture. (For that is true of all such pictures.) But what <i>does</i> characterize the picture is that it can be described <i>completely</i> by a particular net with a <i>particular</i> size of mesh.</p>
<p>Similarly the possibility of computing the imagination by means of Turing-machine software engineering tells us nothing about the imagination: but what does tell us something about it is the precise <i>way</i> in which it is possible to compute it by these means. We are also told something about the imagination by the fact that it can be computed more simply with one system of software engineering than with another.</p>
