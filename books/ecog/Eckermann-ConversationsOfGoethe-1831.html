<div class="section1" id="v12_1831-01-01" title="v12_1831-01-01">
 <h3><i>Sat</i>., <i>Jan</i>. 1.</h3>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p1" title="v12_1831-01-01_p1" class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Of</span> <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>'s letters to various persons, copies of which have been kept in parcels since the year 1807, I have during the last weeks carefully gone through the series of several years. I will in the following paragraphs set down some general remarks, which may be used in some future edition.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p2" title="v12_1831-01-01_p2">1.&mdash;In the first place, the question has arisen,&mdash;whether it is expedient to give these letters merely in the shape of extracts.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p3" title="v12_1831-01-01_p3">To this I reply that altogether it has been <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>'s nature to go to work with some intention even in the smallest matters, and that this seems to have been particu<!--pagestartoriginal-501-->larly the case with regard to these letters, where the author has always devoted his whole soul to the subject, so that not only is every sheet perfectly written from beginning to end, but there is not a line which does not reveal a superior nature and thorough cultivation.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p4" title="v12_1831-01-01_p4">It is my opinion, therefore, that the letters should be given entire, especially as the single passages of importance often receive their true lustre and real significance only through what precedes and follows.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p5" title="v12_1831-01-01_p5">Then, if we look closely at the matter, and fancy these letters laid before a large and varied world, who would presume to say which passage was important and worthy of communication, and which was not? The grammarian, the biographer, the philosopher, the moralist, the man of natural science, the artist, the poet, the academician, the actor, and so on <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i>, have each of them his own peculiar interest, so that one will skip a passage which another regards as highly important, and applies to himself.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p6" title="v12_1831-01-01_p6">Thus, for instance, in the first series belonging to 1807, there is a letter to a friend, whose son is about to devote himself to a forest-life, and to whom <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> prescribes the course which the young man is to adopt. A young author will probably pass over a letter of this kind, while a forester will certainly perceive with delight that the poet has looked at <i>his</i> department as well as others, and has here also tried to give good counsel.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p7" title="v12_1831-01-01_p7">I repeat, therefore, that I am for giving these letters just as they are, without mutilation, especially as they are already distributed entire, and we may be sure that the persons who have received them will some day print them as they have been written.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p8" title="v12_1831-01-01_p8">2.&mdash;If, however, there are letters which one would scruple to publish entire, but which contain good isolated passages, one may copy these passages, and either assign them to the year to which they belong, or make of them a special collection, accordingly as it seems most expedient.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p9" title="v12_1831-01-01_p9">3.&mdash;It is possible that a letter may appear of no importance in the first parcel in which we find it, and that we may be against its publication. If, however, it is found that such a letter has consequences in after years, and may <!--pagestartoriginal-502-->be regarded as the first link of an extended chain, it will be rendered important by this very circumstance, and may be classed with those fit for publication.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p10" title="v12_1831-01-01_p10">4.&mdash;The doubt may arise, whether it is more expedient to arrange the letters according to the persons to whom they are addressed, or to let them follow according to years, without any further order.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p11" title="v12_1831-01-01_p11">I am for the latter method,&mdash;first because it will cause a beautiful and ever refreshing variety; for, when another persons is addressed, not only is there always a change in the style, but the subjects themselves are different, so that the theatre, poetical labours, natural studies, domestic affairs, communications with friends and with persons of rank, pass along in ever-varied succession.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p12" title="v12_1831-01-01_p12">I am also for an arrangement according to years, and without further order, because the letters of any one year, through contemporary influences, not only bear the character of that year, but show the circumstances and occupations of the writer in every direction, so that such letters would be perfectly fitted to complete, with a fresh animated detail, the summary biography of the &ldquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Tag und Jahreshefte</span>,&rdquo; already printed.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p13" title="v12_1831-01-01_p13">5.&mdash;Letters which other persons have already printed, because, perhaps, they contain an acknowledgment of their merits, or some other commendation or peculiarity, should be again introduced in this collection, partly because they belong to the series, partly because these persons will be gratified by the proof afforded to the world that their documents were genuine.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p14" title="v12_1831-01-01_p14">6.&mdash;The question whether a letter of introduction shall be received into the collection or not, shall be decided after due consideration of the person recommended. If he has done nothing, and the letter contains nothing else of value, it is to be omitted; if, on the other hand, he has gained an honourable name in the world, it is to be inserted.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p15" title="v12_1831-01-01_p15">7.&mdash;Letters to persons who are known through <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>'s Life, such as <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Lavater</span>, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Jung</span>, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Behrisch</span>, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kniep</span>, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hackert</span>, and others, are of themselves interesting, and should be published, even if they contain nothing of importance.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p16" title="v12_1831-01-01_p16">8.&mdash;We must not be too fastidious in the publication of these letters, since they give us an idea of <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>'s broad <!--pagestartoriginal-503-->existence and varied influence in all directions; while his deportment towards persons most unlike each other, and in the most different position, may be regarded as highly instructive.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p17" title="v12_1831-01-01_p17">9.&mdash;If several letters treat of the same subject, the best are to be selected; and when a certain point appears in several letters, it should be struck out in some, and left where it is best expressed.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p18" title="v12_1831-01-01_p18">10.&mdash;In the letters of 1811 and 1812, there are perhaps twenty places where the autograph of remarkable persons is requested. These and similar passages must not be suppressed, as they appear highly characteristic and amiable.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p19" title="v12_1831-01-01_p19">The preceding paragraphs have been occasioned by a survey of the letters of 1807, 1808, and 1809. Any general remarks that may occur in the further progress of the work will be added as a supplement.&mdash;E.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-01-01_p21" title="v12_1831-01-01_p21">To-day, after dinner, I discussed this matter with <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, point by point, and he gave his assent to my suggestions. &ldquo;In my will,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will appoint you editor of these papers, and thus show that we have perfectly agreed as the method to be observed.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p id="v3s_1831-01-04_p1" title="v3s_1831-01-04_p1" class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">I</span> perused, with <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, some books of drawings, by my friend T&ouml;pfer, of Geneva, whose talent is equally great as an author and as a draughtsman; but who, until now, appears to have liked to express his lively conceptions in visible forms rather than in transient words. The number which contained the adventures of Doctor Festus, in light pen-and-ink sketches, gave quite the impression of a comic novel, and pleased <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> highly. &ldquo;This is mad stuff, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed he, from time to time, as he turned over one leaf after another; &ldquo;all sparkles with talent and intelligence Some pages could not be excelled. If, for the future, he would choose a less frivolous subject, and restrict himself a little, he would produce things beyond all conception.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3s_1831-01-04_p2" title="v3s_1831-01-04_p2">&ldquo;He has been compared with <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Rabelais</span>,&rdquo; remarked I, &ldquo;and reproached with having imitated him and borrowed his ideas.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3s_1831-01-17_p1" title="v3s_1831-01-17_p1" class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">I</span> found Coudray with <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, examining some architectural drawings. I had about me a five-<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">franc</span> piece of 1830, with the likeness of <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Charles</span> the Tenth, which I produced. <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> joked about the pointed head. &ldquo;The organ of Veneration appears to have been very largely developed in him.&rdquo; remarked he. &ldquo;Doubtless, from his excessive piety, he did not deem it necessary to pay his debts; on the other hand, we are deeply indebted to him, since, thanks to the freaks of his genius, Europe will not soon be quiet again.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3s_1831-01-17_p2" title="v3s_1831-01-17_p2">We spoke about &ldquo;<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Rouge et Noir</span>,&rdquo; which <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> regarded as <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Stendhal</span>'s best work.</p>

<p id="v3s_1831-01-17_p3" title="v3s_1831-01-17_p3">&ldquo;Still I cannot deny,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;that some of his female characters are a little too romantic. Nevertheless, they all give evidence of great observation and psychological penetration, so that one may willingly pardon the author for some improbability in his details.&rdquo;</p></div>

His grandchildren were amusing themselves with conjuring tricks, in which <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Walter</span> is particularly skilful. &ldquo;I do not object,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;to the boys filling up their spare hours with these follies. It is, especially in the presence of a small public, an excellent means of exercise in speaking freely, and acquiring some bodily and mental activity, of which we Germans have by no means a superabundance. The slight vanity that is occasioned is a disadvantage which is certainly over-balanced by such a gain.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3s_1831-01-23_p2" title="v3s_1831-01-23_p2">&ldquo;Besides, the spectators take care enough to damp such feelings,&rdquo; remarked I, &ldquo;because they generally look very sharply at the little juggler's fingers, and are malicious enough to laugh at his blunders, and to mortify him by publishing his little secrets.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-09_p1" title="v12_1831-02-09_p1" class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Yesterday</span> I continued reading Voss's &ldquo;Luise&rdquo; with the Prince, and made to myself several re<!--pagestartoriginal-505-->marks on the subject of that book. The great merits of the author in depicting the locality, and the external circumstances of the persons, delighted me; still, it appeared to me that the poem should have had a more lofty import,&mdash;and this remark especially occurred to me in those passages where the persons express their sentiments in dialogue. In the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield&rdquo; there is also a country pastor with his family, but the poet had a higher knowledge of the world, and this was communicated to his personages, all of whom exhibit greater mental variety. In the &ldquo;Luise&rdquo; all stand on the level of a narrow cultivation, though there is sufficient to satisfy thoroughly a certain class of readers. As for the verse, it seems to me that the hexameter is far too pretentious for such narrow subjects, and is, moreover, often a little forced and affected, and that the periods do not always flow naturally enough to be read with ease.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-09_p2" title="v12_1831-02-09_p2">To-day, at dinner, I talked over this point with <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>. &ldquo;The earlier editions of the poem,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are far better in that respect, and I remember that I read it aloud with pleasure. Afterwards Voss touched it up a great deal, and, from his technical crotchets, spoiled the ease and nature of the verse. Indeed, nowadays technicalities are everything, and the critics begin to torment themselves,&mdash;whether in a rhyme an S should be followed by an S, and not an S by a &lsquo;double S.&rsquo; If I were young and bold enough, I would purposely offend against all these technical whims; I would employ alliteration, assonance, false rhyme, and anything else that came into my head, but I would keep the main point in view, and endeavour to say such good things that every one would be tempted to read them and to learn them by heart.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="section1" id="v12_1831-02-11" title="v12_1831-02-11">

<p id="v12_1831-02-11_p1" title="v12_1831-02-11_p1" class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">To-day</span>, at dinner, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> told me that he had begun the fourth act of &ldquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Faust</span>,&rdquo; and thus intended to proceed, which pleased me highly. He then spoke with great praise of Carl Sch&ouml;ne, a young philologist of Leipsic, who had written a work on the costume in the tragedies of Euripides, and who, notwithstanding his great learning, had displayed no more of it than was necessary for his purpose.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-11_p2" title="v12_1831-02-11_p2">&ldquo;I like to see,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;how, with a productive <!--pagestartoriginal-506-->sense, he goes to the point at once, while other modern philologists give themselves far too much trouble about technicalities, and long and short syllables.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-11_p3" title="v12_1831-02-11_p3">&ldquo;It is always a sign that a time is unproductive when it goes so much into technical minuti&aelig;; and thus also it is a sign that an individual is unproductive when he occupies himself in a like manner.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-11_p4" title="v12_1831-02-11_p4">&ldquo;Then there are other faults which act as impediments. Thus, for instance, in Count Platen there are nearly all the chief requisites of a good poet;&mdash;imagination, invention, intellect, and productiveness, he possesses in a high degree; he also shows a thoroughly technical cultivation, and a study and earnestness, to be found in few others. With him, however, his unhappy polemical tendency is a hindrance.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-11_p5" title="v12_1831-02-11_p5">&ldquo;That amid the grandeur of Naples and Rome he could not forget the miserable trivialities of German literature, is unpardonable in so eminent a genius. The &lsquo;Romantic &OElig;dipus&rsquo; shows that, especially with regard to technicalities, Platen was just the man to write the best German tragedy; but now, in this piece, he has used the tragic <i>motives</i> for purposes of parody, how will he write a tragedy in good earnest?</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-11_p6" title="v12_1831-02-11_p6">&ldquo;And then (what is not enough kept in mind) these quarrels occupy the thoughts; the images of our foes are like ghosts which intercept all free production, and cause great disorder in a nature already sufficiently susceptible.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-11_p7" title="v12_1831-02-11_p7">&ldquo;Lord Byron was ruined by his polemic tendency; and Platen should, for the honour of German literature, quit for ever so unprofitable a path.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p2" title="v12_1831-02-13_p2">&ldquo;I had,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;long since the <i>what</i>, as you know, but was not quite satisfied about the <i>how</i>; hence it is the more pleasant that good thoughts have come to me.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p3" title="v12_1831-02-13_p3">&ldquo;I will now go on inventing, to supply the whole gap, from the &lsquo;Helena&rsquo; to the fifth act, which is finished, and write down a detailed plan, that I may work with perfect comfort and security on those parts which first attract me.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p4" title="v12_1831-02-13_p4">&ldquo;This act acquires quite a peculiar character, so that, like an independent little world, it does not touch the rest, and is only connected with the whole by a slight reference to what precedes and follows.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p5" title="v12_1831-02-13_p5">&ldquo;It will then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;be perfectly in character with the rest; for, in fact, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Auerbach</span>'s cellar, the witches' kitchen, the <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Blocksberg</span>, the imperial diet, the masquerade, the paper-money, the laboratory, the classic <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Walpurgis</span>-night, the Helena, are all of them little independent worlds, which, each being complete in itself, do indeed work upon each other, yet come but little in contact. The great point with the poet is to express a manifold world, and he uses the story of a celebrated hero merely as a sort of thread on which he may string what he pleases. This is the case with &lsquo;Gil Blas&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Odyssey.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p6" title="v12_1831-02-13_p6">&ldquo;You are perfectly right,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>; &ldquo;and the only matter of importance in such compositions is, that the single masses should be clear and significant, while the whole always remains incommensurable,&mdash;and even on that account, like an unsolved problem, constantly lures mankind to study it again and again.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p7" title="v12_1831-02-13_p7">I then spoke of a letter from a young soldier, whom I and other friends had advised to go into foreign service, and who now, not being pleased with his situation abroad, blames all those who advised him.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p8" title="v12_1831-02-13_p8">&ldquo;Advice is a strange matter,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;and when one has looked about one in the world long enough, to see how the most judicious enterprises fail, and the most absurd often succeed, one becomes disinclined to give advice to any one. At bottom, too, there is a confinement with respect to him who asks advice, and a presumption in him who gives it. A person should only give advice in matters <!--pagestartoriginal-508-->where he himself will co-operate. If any one asks me for good advice, I say I am ready to give it, but only on condition that he will promise me not to take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p9" title="v12_1831-02-13_p9">The conversation turned on the New Testament, and I mentioned that I had been reading again the passage where Christ walks on the sea, and Peter meets him.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p10" title="v12_1831-02-13_p10">&ldquo;When one has not for some time read the Evangelists,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;one is always astonished at the moral grandeur of the figures. We find in the lofty demands made upon our moral power of will a sort of categorical imperative.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p11" title="v12_1831-02-13_p11">&ldquo;Especially,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;you find the categorical imperative of faith, which, indeed, Mahomet carried still farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p12" title="v12_1831-02-13_p12">&ldquo;Altogether,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the Evangelists, if you look closely into them, are full of differences and contradictions; and the books must have gone through strange revolutions of destiny before they were brought together in the form in which we have them now.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p13" title="v12_1831-02-13_p13">&ldquo;It is like trying to drink out a sea,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;to enter into an historical and critical examination of them. It is the best way, without farther ado, to adhere to that which is set down, and to appropriate to oneself so much as one can use for one's moral strengthening and culture. However, it is pleasant to get a clear notion of the localities, and I can recommend you to nothing better than <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">R&ouml;hr</span>'s admirable book on Palestine. The late Grand Duke was so pleased with this book, that he bought it twice, giving the first copy to the library, after he had read it, and keeping the other always by him.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p14" title="v12_1831-02-13_p14">I wondered that the Grand Duke should take an interest in such matters.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p15" title="v12_1831-02-13_p15">&ldquo;Therein,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;he was great. He was interested in everything of any importance, in whatsoever department it lay. He was always progressive, and sought to domesticate with himself all the good inventions and institutions of his time. If anything failed, he spoke of it no more. I often thought how I should excuse to him this or that failure; but he always ignored it in the cheerfulest way, and was immediately engaged with some new plan. This was a greatness peculiar to his own nature; not acquired, but innate.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p16" title="v12_1831-02-13_p16"><!--pagestartoriginal-509-->We looked, after dinner, at some engravings after the most modern artists, especially in the landscape department, and we remarked with pleasure that nothing false could be detected.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p17" title="v12_1831-02-13_p17">&ldquo;For ages there has been so much good in the world,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;that one ought not in reason to wonder when it operates and produces good in its turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p18" title="v12_1831-02-13_p18">&ldquo;The worst of it is,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that there are so many false doctrines, and that a young genius does not know to what saint he should devote himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p19" title="v12_1831-02-13_p19">&ldquo;Of this we have proofs,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>; &ldquo;we have seen whole generations ruined or injured by false maxims, and have also suffered ourselves. Then there is the facility nowadays of universally diffusing every error by means of printing. Though a critic may think better after some years, and diffuse among the public his better convictions, his false doctrine has operated in the mean while, and will in future, like a spreading weed, continue to co-operate with what is good. My only consolation is, that a really great talent is not to be led astray or spoiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p20" title="v12_1831-02-13_p20">We looked further at the engravings, &ldquo;These are really good things,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>. &ldquo;You have before you the works of very fair talents, who have learned something, and have acquired no little taste and art. Still, something is wanting in all these pictures&mdash;the <i>Manly</i>. Take notice of this word, and underscore it. The pictures lack a certain urgent power, which in former ages was generally expressed, but in which the present age is deficient, and that with respect not only to painting, but to all the other arts. We have a more weakly race, of which we cannot say whether it is so by its origin, or by a more weakly training and diet.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p21" title="v12_1831-02-13_p21">&ldquo;We see here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how much in art depends on a great <a href="#v12_1831-02-13_n1" id="v12_1831-02-13_a1" title="vol1/2 1831-02-13 note 1">personality,<sup>[1]</sup></a> which indeed was common enough in earlier ages. When, at Venice, we stand before the works of Titian and Paul Veronese, we feel the powerful mind of these men, both in their first conception of the subject, and in the final execution. Their great energetic feeling has <!--pagestartoriginal-510-->penetrated the members of the whole picture, and this higher power of the artist's personality expands our own nature, and elevates us above ourselves, when we contemplate such works. This manly mind of which you speak is also to be found especially in the landscapes of <span xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">Rubens</span>. They, indeed, consist merely of trees, soil, water, rocks, and clouds, but his own bold temperament has penetrated into the forms, and thus while we see familiar nature we see it penetrated by the power of the artist, and reproduced according to his views.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p22" title="v12_1831-02-13_p22">&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;personality is everything in art and poetry; nevertheless, there are many weak personages among the modern critics who do not admit this, but look upon a great personality in a work of poetry or art merely as a kind of trifling appendage.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-13_p23" title="v12_1831-02-13_p23">&ldquo;However, to feel and respect a great personality one must be something oneself. All those who denied the sublime to Euripides were either poor wretches incapable of comprehending such sublimity, or shameless charlatans, who, by their presumption, wished to make more of themselves, and really did make more of themselves than they were.&rdquo;</p>

He had been reading the memoirs of General <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Rapp</span>, through which the conversation turned upon Napoleon, and the feelings which must necessarily have been experienced by Madame Letitia at finding herself the mother of so powerful a family. She had given birth to Napoleon, her second son, when she was eighteen years old, and her husband three-and-twenty, so that he had a physical advantage in the youthful strength of his parents. After him she bore three sons, all remarkably endowed, clever and energetic in practical things, and all with a certain poetical talent. These four sons are followed by three daughters, and last of all comes Jerome, who seems to have been the least endowed of all.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-14_p2" title="v12_1831-02-14_p2">Talent is indeed not hereditary, but it requires an apt physical substratum, and then it is by no means indifferent whether one is the first or the last born, nor whether one is the issue of strong and young, or weak and old parents.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-14_p3" title="v12_1831-02-14_p3">&ldquo;It is remarkable,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that, of all talents, the musical shows itself earliest; so that <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Mozart</span> in his fifth, <!--pagestartoriginal-511--><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Beethoven</span> in his eighth, and <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hummel</span> in his ninth year, astonished all near them by their performance and compositions.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-14_p4" title="v12_1831-02-14_p4">&ldquo;The musical talent,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;may well show itself earliest of any; for music is something innate and internal, which needs little nourishment from without, and no experience drawn from life. Really, however, a phenomenon like that of <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Mozart</span> remains an inexplicable prodigy. But how would the Divinity find everywhere opportunity to do wonders, if he did not sometimes try his powers on extraordinary individuals, at whom we stand astonished, and cannot understand whence they come?&rdquo;</p></div>

I told him about the theatre; he praised the piece given yesterday&mdash;&ldquo;Henry III.,&rdquo; by <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Dumas</span>&mdash;as very excellent, but naturally found that such a dish would not suit the public.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-15_p2" title="v12_1831-02-15_p2">&ldquo;I should not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have ventured to give it, when I was director; for I remember well what trouble we had to smuggle upon the public the <a href="#v12_1831-02-15_n1" id="v12_1831-02-15_a1" title="vol1/2 1831-02-15 note 1">&lsquo;Constant Prince,&rsquo;<sup>[1]</sup></a> which has far more general human interest, is more poetic, and in fact lies much nearer to us, than &lsquo;Henry III.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-15_p3" title="v12_1831-02-15_p3">I spoke of the &ldquo;Grand Cophta,&rdquo; which I had been lately re-perusing. I talked over the scenes one by one, and, at last, expressed a wish to see it once on the stage.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-15_p4" title="v12_1831-02-15_p4">&ldquo;I am pleased,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;that you like that piece, and find out what I have worked into it. It was indeed no little labour to make an entirely real fact first poetical, and then theatrical. And yet you will grant that the whole is properly conceived for the stage. <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Schiller</span> was, also, very partial to it; and we gave it once, with brilliant effect, for the higher order of persons. But it is not for the public in general; the crimes of which it treats have about them an <i>apprehensive</i> character, which produces an uncomfortable feeling in the people. Its bold character places it, indeed, in the sphere of &lsquo;<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Clara Gazul</span>;&rsquo; and the French poet might really envy me for taking from him so good a subject. I say <i>so good a subject</i>, because it is in truth not merely of moral, but also of great historical significance; the fact immediately preceded the French Revolution, and <!--pagestartoriginal-512-->was, to a certain extent, its foundation. The Queen, through being implicated in that unlucky story of the necklace, lost her dignity, and was no longer respected, so that she lost, in the eyes of the people, the ground where she was unassailable. Hate injures no one; it is contempt that casts men down. <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kotzebue</span> had been hated long; but before the student dared to use his dagger upon him, it was necessary for certain journals to make him contemptible.&rdquo;</p>

I brought him his &ldquo;Residence at Carlsbad,&rdquo; for the year 1807, which I had finished revising that morning. We spoke of wise passages, which occur there as hasty remarks of the day.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-17_p2" title="v12_1831-02-17_p2">&ldquo;People always fancy,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, laughing, &ldquo;that we must become old to become wise; but, in truth, as years advance, it is hard to keep ourselves as wise as we were. Man becomes, indeed, in the different stages of his life, a different being; but he cannot say that he is a better one, and, in certain matters, he is as likely to be right in his twentieth, as in his sixtieth year.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-17_p3" title="v12_1831-02-17_p3">&ldquo;We see the world one way from a plain, another way from the heights of a promontory, another from the glacier fields of the primary mountains. We see, from one of these points, a larger piece of the world than from the other; but that is all, and we cannot say that we see more truly from any one than from the rest. When a writer leaves monuments on the different steps of his life, it is chiefly important that he should have an innate foundation and good-will; that he should, at each step, have seen and felt clearly, and that, without any secondary aims, he should have said distinctly and truly what has passed in his mind. Then will his writings, if they were right at the step where they originated, remain always right, however the writer may develop or alter himself in after times.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-17_p4" title="v12_1831-02-17_p4">I heartily assented to this excellent remark.</p>

For, as I am always striving onwards, I <!--pagestartoriginal-513-->forget what I have written, and soon regard my productions as something quite foreign.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-17_p6" title="v12_1831-02-17_p6">I asked about &ldquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Faust</span>,&rdquo; and what progress he had made with it.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-17_p7" title="v12_1831-02-17_p7">&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;will not again let me loose. I daily think and invent more and more of it. I have now had the whole manuscript of the second part stitched together, that it may lie a palpable mass before me. The place of the yet wanting fourth act I have filled with white paper; and, undoubtedly, what is finished will allure and urge me to complete what has yet to be done. There is more than people think in these matters of sense, and we must aid the spiritual by all manner of devices.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-17_p8" title="v12_1831-02-17_p8">He sent for the stitched &ldquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Faust</span>,&rdquo; and I was surprised to see how much he had written; for a good folio volume was before me.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-17_p9" title="v12_1831-02-17_p9">&ldquo;And all,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;has been done in the six years that I have been here; and yet, amid so many other occupations, you could have devoted but little time to it. We see how much a work grows, even if we only now and then add something!&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-17_p10" title="v12_1831-02-17_p10">&ldquo;Of that one is still more convinced as one grows older,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>; &ldquo;while youth believes all must be done in a single day. If fortune favour, and I continue in good health, I hope in the next spring-months to get a great way on with the fourth act. It was, as you know, long since invented; but the other parts have, in the course of the execution, grown so much, that I can now use only the outline of my first invention, and must fill out this introduced portion so as to make it of a piece with the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-17_p11" title="v12_1831-02-17_p11">&ldquo;A far richer world is displayed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in this second part than in the first.&rdquo;</p>

But, in the second part, there is scarcely anything of the subjective; here is seen a higher, broader, clearer, more passionless world, and he who has not looked about him and had some experience, will not know what to make of it.&rdquo;</p>

It will be found that one cannot succeed in the long run with over-great goodness, mildness, and moral delicacy, while one has beneath a mixed and sometimes vicious world to manage and hold in respect.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-18_p2" title="v12_1831-02-18_p2">It was also remarked that the art of governing is a great <i>metier</i>, requiring the whole man, and that it is therefore not well for a ruler to have too strong tendencies for other affairs, as, for instance, a predominant inclination for the fine arts; since thus not only the interest of the Prince, but also the powers of the State, must be withdrawn from more necessary matters.

A pamphlet on the island of Heligoland had been sent to <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, which he read with great interest, telling us what he found most important in it.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-19_p2" title="v12_1831-02-19_p2">After we had talked about this very peculiar locality, conversation took a medical turn, and <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Vogel</span> told us, as the news of the day, how the natural small-pox, in defiance of all inoculation, had again broken out in <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Eisenach</span>, and had carried off many in a short time.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-19_p3" title="v12_1831-02-19_p3">&ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Vogel</span>, &ldquo;plays us a trick every now and then; and we must watch her very closely, if our theory is to keep pace with her. Inoculation was thought so sure and infallible, that a law was made to enforce it. But now this <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Eisenach</span> affair, where the persons who have been inoculated are nevertheless attacked by the natural small-pox, casts a suspicion on the infallibility of the remedy, and weakens the motive for observing the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-19_p4" title="v12_1831-02-19_p4">&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;I am against any departure from the strict law for inoculation, since these trifling exceptions are nothing in comparison with the great benefits which it confers.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-19_p5" title="v12_1831-02-19_p5">&ldquo;I am of the same opinion,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Vogel</span>, &ldquo;and would even maintain that in all cases where the natural disease is not prevented by the artificial one, the inoculation has been imperfect. For inoculation to have a protective power it must be strong enough to produce fever. Mere irritation of the skin without fever will not suffice. I have this day proposed in council that a stronger inoculation for the small-pox shall be incumbent on all the parties throughout the country who have to perform it.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-19_p6" title="v12_1831-02-19_p6">&ldquo;I hope that your proposal has been carried,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>. &ldquo;Indeed, I am always for a rigid adherence to a law, especially at a time like ours, when out of weakness and excessive liberality one is always conceding too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-19_p7" title="v12_1831-02-19_p7">It was then remarked that we were beginning to be too gentle and lax with regard to the responsibility of criminals, and that medical testimony and opinion often had the effect of making the criminal evade the penalty he had incurred. On this occasion <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Vogel</span> praised a young physician, who had always shown strength of character in such cases, and who lately, when the court was in doubt whether a certain <!--pagestartoriginal-516-->infanticide was responsible or not, had given his testimony that she unquestionably was so.</p></div>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p1" title="v12_1831-02-20_p1" class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Dined</span> with <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>. He told me that he had tested my observation on the blue shadows in the snow, viz. that they were produced by the reflection of the blue sky, and that he acknowledged its correctness. &ldquo;But both causes may, however, co-operate.&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and the demand (<i><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Forderung</span></i>) excited by the yellowish light may strengthen the appearance of the blue.&rdquo; This I willingly conceded, and rejoiced that <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> at last agreed with me.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p2" title="v12_1831-02-20_p2">&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I did not on the spot write down the observations on colour which I made at Mont Rose and <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mont Blanc</span>. The chief result, however, was, that at a distance of from eighteen to twenty miles, in the brightest noonday sun, the snow appeared yellow and even reddish, while the dark parts of the mountains, which were free from snow, stood out in the most decided blue. This phenomenon did not surprise me, as I could have predicted that the semi-transparent mass which intervened would give a deep yellow tone to the white snow as it reflected the noonday sun; but, nevertheless, it pleased me, inasmuch as it fully confuted the erroneous opinion of some scientific persons, that the air has the property of giving a blue colour. For if the air had been blue of itself, the snow, for a space of twenty miles&mdash;that is to say, the distance between me and Mont Rose&mdash;must have appeared bright blue, or a whitish blue, and not yellow and yellowish red.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p3" title="v12_1831-02-20_p3">&ldquo;This observation,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;is important, and completely confutes every error.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p4" title="v12_1831-02-20_p4">&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the doctrine of the dense medium is so simple that one is easily misled into the belief that it can be communicated to another in a few days. The difficulty is to apply the law, and to recognize a primitive phenomenon in phenomena that are conditioned and concealed a thousand different ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p5" title="v12_1831-02-20_p5">&ldquo;I will compare it with whist,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;the laws and rules of which are very easy to teach, but which one must have played a long time before one can become a master. Altogether we learn nothing from mere hearing, and he who does not take an active part in certain subjects knows them but half and superficially.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p6" title="v12_1831-02-20_p6"><!--pagestartoriginal-517--><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> then told me of the book of a young natural philosopher, which he could not help praising, on account of the clearness of his descriptions, while he pardoned him for his teleological tendency.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p7" title="v12_1831-02-20_p7">&ldquo;It is natural to man,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;to regard himself as the final cause of creation, and to consider all other things merely in relation to himself so far as they are of use to him. He makes himself master of the vegetable and animal world, and while he claims other creatures as a fitting diet, he acknowledges his God, and praises His goodness in this paternal care. He takes milk from the cow, honey from the bee, wool from the sheep; and while he gives these things a purpose which is useful to himself, he believes that they were made on that account. Nay, he cannot conceive that even the smallest herb was not made for him, and if he has not yet ascertained its utility, he believes that he may discover it in future.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p8" title="v12_1831-02-20_p8">&ldquo;Then, too, as man thinks in general, so does he always think in particular, and he does not fail to transfer his ordinary views from life into science, and to ask the use and purpose of every single part of our organic being.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p9" title="v12_1831-02-20_p9">&ldquo;This may do for a time, and he may get on so for a time in science, but he will soon come to phenomena, where this small view will not be sufficient, and where, if he does not take a higher stand, he will soon be involved in mere contradictions.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p10" title="v12_1831-02-20_p10">&ldquo;The utility-teachers say that oxen have horns to defend themselves; but I ask, why is the sheep without any&mdash;and when it has them, why are they twisted about the ears so as to answer no purpose at all?</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p11" title="v12_1831-02-20_p11">&ldquo;If, on the other hand, I say the ox defends himself with his horns because he has them, it is quite a different matter.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p12" title="v12_1831-02-20_p12">&ldquo;The question as to the purpose&mdash;the question <i>Wherefore</i> is completely unscientific. But we get on farther with the question <i>How</i>? For if I ask <i>how</i> has the ox horns, I am led to study his organization, and learn at the same time why the lion has no horns, and cannot have any.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p13" title="v12_1831-02-20_p13">&ldquo;Thus, man has in his skull two hollows which are never filled up. The question <i>wherefore</i> could not take us far in this case, but the question <i>how</i> informs me <!--pagestartoriginal-518-->that these hollows are remains of the animal skull, which are found on a larger scale in inferior organization, and are not quite obliterated in man, with all his eminence.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p14" title="v12_1831-02-20_p14">&ldquo;The teachers of utility would think that they lost their God if they did not worship Him who gave the ox horns to defend itself. But I hope I may be allowed to worship Him who, in the abundance of His creation, was great enough, after making a thousand kinds of plants, to make one more, in which all the rest should be comprised; and after a thousand kinds of animals, a being which comprises them all&mdash;a man.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-20_p15" title="v12_1831-02-20_p15">&ldquo;let people serve Him who gives to the beast his fodder, and to man meat and drink as much as he can enjoy. But I worship Him who has infused into the world such a power of production, that, when only the millionth part of it comes out into life, the world swarms with creatures to such a degree that war, pestilence, fire, and water cannot prevail against them. That is <i>my</i> God!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p id="v12_1831-02-21_p2" title="v12_1831-02-21_p2">&ldquo;It is thoroughly good,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and we rejoice once again at the distinguished talent which we have long known and revered. In this case he had an excellent subject and a worthy purpose, and his success has been as great as possible. If the same could be said of the subject and purpose of his work on the Cabiri, that would claim praise from us also, since there also he has displayed in it his rhetorical talent and art.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-21_p4" title="v12_1831-02-21_p4">&ldquo;The old <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Walpurgis</span>-night,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;is monarchical, since the devil is there respected throughout as a decided chief. But the classic <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Walpurgis</span>-night is thoroughly republican; since all stand on a plain near one another, so that each is as prominent as his associates, and nobody is subordinate or troubled about the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-21_p5" title="v12_1831-02-21_p5">&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in the classic assembly all are sharply outlined individualities, while, on the German <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Blocksberg</span>, each individuality is lost in the general witch-mass.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-21_p6" title="v12_1831-02-21_p6"><!--pagestartoriginal-519-->&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;Mephistophiles knows what is meant when the Homunculus speaks to him of <i>Thessalian</i> witches. A connoisseur of antiquity will have something suggested by these words (Thessalian witches), while to the unlearned it remains a mere name.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-21_p7" title="v12_1831-02-21_p7">&ldquo;Antiquity,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;must be very living to you, else you could not make all these figures step so freshly into life, and treat them with such freedom as you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-21_p8" title="v12_1831-02-21_p8">&ldquo;Without a lifelong occupation with plastic art,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;it would not have been possible to me. The difficulty was in observing due moderation amid such plenty, and avoiding all figures that did not perfectly fit into my plan. I made, for instance, no use of the Minotaur, the Harpies, and certain other monsters.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-21_p9" title="v12_1831-02-21_p9">&ldquo;But what you have exhibited in that night,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is so grouped, and fits so well together, that it can be easily recalled by the imagination and made into a picture. The painters will certainly not allow such good subjects to escape them; and I especially hope to see Mephistophiles among the Phorcyades, when he tries the famous mask in profile.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-21_p10" title="v12_1831-02-21_p10">&ldquo;There are a few pleasantries there,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;which will more or less occupy the world in all sorts of ways. Suppose the French are the first to perceive &lsquo;Helena,&rsquo; and to see what can be done with it for the stage. They will spoil the piece as it is, but they will make a wise use of it for their own purposes, and that is all we can expect or desire. To Phorcyas they will certainly add a chorus of monsters, as is indeed already indicated in one passage.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-21_p11" title="v12_1831-02-21_p11">&ldquo;It would be a great matter,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if a clever part of the romantic school treated the piece as an opera throughout, and <span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Rossini</span> collected all his great talent for a grand composition, to produce an effect with the &lsquo;Helena.&rsquo; It affords opportunities for magnificent scenes, surprising transformations, brilliant costumes, and charming ballets, which are not easily to be found elsewhere, to say nothing of the fact that this abundance of sensible material rests on the foundation of an ingenious fable that could scarcely be excelled.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-21_p12" title="v12_1831-02-21_p12">&ldquo;We will wait for what the gods bring us,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, <!--pagestartoriginal-520-->&ldquo;such things are not to be hurried.

<p id="v12_1831-02-23_p2" title="v12_1831-02-23_p2">The mountains and hills were covered with snow, and I mentioned the great delicacy of the yellow, observing that at a distance of nine miles, with some density intervening, a dark surface rather appeared blue than a white one yellow. <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> agreed with me, and we then spoke of the high significance of the primitive phenomena, behind which we believe the Deity may directly be discerned.</p>

That the sun stands still, that he does not rise and set, but that the earth performs a diurnal revolution with incredible swiftness, contradicts the senses as much as anything, but yet no well-informed person doubts that this is the case.

I thought, with admiration, what it must have cost to put such work together, since I observed not merely the final results, but looked deeper, and saw what must have been gone through that these firm results might be attained.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-26_p2" title="v12_1831-02-26_p2">Only a man of great moral power could accomplish this, and whoever would imitate him must take a very high position. All that is indelicate, untrue, egotistical, must vanish from the mind, or real true nature must scorn him. If men considered this, they would willingly devote some <!--pagestartoriginal-522-->years of their life to master the sphere of such a science in such a manner, that they might thus test their senses, intellect, and character. They would have respect for all that is according to law, and approach the Deity as closely as it is possible for a terrestrial mind.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-26_p3" title="v12_1831-02-26_p3">On the contrary, people occupy themselves too much with poetry, and supersensuous mysteries which are subjective, pliable things, making no further claims on man, but flattering him, and, at best, leaving him just where he was.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-26_p4" title="v12_1831-02-26_p4">In poetry, only the really great and pure advances us; and this exists as a second nature, either elevating us to itself or rejecting us. On the other hand, defective poetry develops our faults, inasmuch as we take into ourselves the infectious weaknesses of the poet. Yes, take them in, without knowing it, because we cannot perceive a defect in that which is consonant to our nature.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-26_p5" title="v12_1831-02-26_p5">To draw advantage from both the good and the bad in poetry, we must already be in a very high position, and have such a foundation that we can regard things of the sort as objects external to ourselves.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-26_p6" title="v12_1831-02-26_p6">Hence I commend an intercourse with nature, who in no wise favours our weaknesses, but either makes something out of us, or will have nothing at all to do with us.</p></div>

I am very happy with this work, when I reflect what it already is, and what it may become. Some books appear quite complete, and leave nothing to desire. In others, on the contrary, a certain want of congruity may be observed, which may have arisen from the fact that the author has worked at very different epochs.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p2" title="v12_1831-02-28_p2">This fourth volume is altogether very different from the three preceding. Those constantly proceed in a certain given direction, while the course is through many years. In this volume, on the contrary, time seems scarcely to move, and we can see no decisive effort on the part of the principal character; much is undertaken but not completed, much is willed but otherwise directed, and thus we everywhere feel the influence of a secret power, a kind of destiny, <!--pagestartoriginal-523-->drawing out many threads for the web which future years must complete.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p3" title="v12_1831-02-28_p3">This volume, therefore, affords a suitable occasion to speak of that secret, problematical power, which all men feel, which no philosopher explains, and over which the religious help themselves with consoling words.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p4" title="v12_1831-02-28_p4"><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> names this unspeakable world and life-enigma the D&aelig;monic (<i><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">d&auml;monisch</span></i>); and, while he defines its nature, we feel that so it is, and the curtains seem to have been drawn away from before certain backgrounds of our life. We seem to see further and more clearly, but soon perceive that the object is too great and manifold, and that our eyes only reach a certain limit.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p5" title="v12_1831-02-28_p5">Man is born only for the little; only what is known to him can be comprehended by him, or give him pleasure. A great connoisseur understands a picture; he knows how to combine the various particulars into the Universal, which is familiar to him; the whole is, to him, as living as the details. Neither does he entertain a predilection for detached portions; he asks not whether a face is ugly or beautiful, whether a passage is light or dark, but whether everything is in its place, according to law and order. But if we show an ignorant man a picture of some compass, we shall see that, as a <i>whole</i>, it leaves him unmoved or confused; that some parts attract, others repel him; and that he at last abides by little things which are familiar to him, praising, perhaps, the good execution of a helmet or plume.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p6" title="v12_1831-02-28_p6">But, in fact, we men play more or less the part of this ignorant person before the great destiny-picture of the world. The lighted part, the Agreeable, attracts us, the shadowy and unpleasant parts repel us, the whole confuses us, and we vainly seek the idea of a single Being to whom we attribute such contradictions.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p7" title="v12_1831-02-28_p7">Now, in human things, one may indeed become a great connoisseur, inasmuch as one may appropriate to oneself the art and knowledge of a master, but, in divine things, this is only possible with a being equal to the Highest. Nay, if the Supreme Being attempted to reveal such mysteries to us, we should not understand them or know what to do with them; but again resemble that ignoramus before the picture, to whom the connoisseur cannot by all <!--pagestartoriginal-524-->the talking in the world impart the premises on which he judges. On this account it is quite right that forms of religion have not been given directly by God himself, but, as the work of eminent men, have been conformed to the wants and the understanding of a great mass of their fellows. If they were the work of God, no man could understand them; but, being the work of men, they do not express the Inscrutable.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p8" title="v12_1831-02-28_p8">The religion of the highly-cultivated ancient Greeks went no further than to give separate expressions of the Inscrutable by particular Deities. As these individualities were only limited beings, and a gap was obvious in the connection of the whole, they invented the idea of a Fate, which they placed over all; but as this in its turn remained a many-sided Inscrutable, the difficulty was rather set aside than disposed of.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p9" title="v12_1831-02-28_p9">Christ thought of a God, comprising all in one, to whom he ascribed all qualities which he found excellent in himself. This God was the essence of his own beautiful soul; full of love and goodness, like himself: and every way suited to induce good men to give themselves up trustingly to him, and to receive this Idea, as the sweetest connection with a higher sphere. But, as the great Being whom we name the Deity manifests himself not only in man, but in a rich, powerful nature, and in mighty world-events, a representation of him, framed from human qualities, cannot of course be adequate, and the attentive observer will soon come to imperfections and contradictions, which will drive him to doubt, nay, to despair, unless he be either little enough to let himself be soothed by an artful evasion, or great enough to rise to a higher point of view.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p10" title="v12_1831-02-28_p10">Such a point <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> early found in Spinoza; and he acknowledges with joy how much the views of that great thinker answered the wants of his youth. In him he found himself, and in him therefore could he fortify himself to the best advantage.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p11" title="v12_1831-02-28_p11">And as these views were not of the subjective sort, but had a foundation in the works and manifestations of God through the world, so were the not mere husks which he, after his own later, deeper search into the world and nature, threw aside as useless, but were the first root and germ of <!--pagestartoriginal-525-->a plant that went on growing with equally healthy energy for many years, and at last unfolded the flower of a rich knowledge.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p12" title="v12_1831-02-28_p12">His opponents have often accused him of having no faith; but he merely had not theirs, because it was too small for him. If he spoke out his own, they would be astonished; but they would not be able to comprehend him.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p13" title="v12_1831-02-28_p13">But <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> is far from believing that he knows the Highest Being as it is. All his written and oral expressions intimate that it is somewhat inscrutable, of which men can only have approximating perceptions and feelings.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p14" title="v12_1831-02-28_p14">For the rest, nature and we men are all so penetrated by the Divine, that it holds us; that we live, move, and have our being in it; that we suffer and are happy under eternal laws; that we practise these, and they are practised on us, whether we recognize them or not.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-02-28_p15" title="v12_1831-02-28_p15">The child enjoys his cake without knowing anything of the baker; the sparrow the cherries, without thinking how they grew.</p></div>

Our late Grand Duke, too, was a d&aelig;monic nature, full of unlimited power of action and unrest, so that his own dominion was too little for him, and the greatest would have been too little. D&aelig;monic beings of such sort the Greeks reckoned among their demigods.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-02_p5" title="v12_1831-03-02_p5">&ldquo;Is not the D&aelig;monic,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;perceptible in events also?&rdquo;</p>

We spoke of children and their naughty tricks, and he compared these to the stem-leaves of a plant, which fall away gradually of their own accord; and which need not be corrected with great severity.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-06_p2" title="v12_1831-03-06_p2">&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has various stages which he must go through, and each brings with it its peculiar virtues and faults, which, in the epoch to which they belong, are to be considered natural, and in a manner right.

This scene, and all the rest, were written in the tone of <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Faust</span>. A productive force, powerful even to wantonness, displayed itself in every line; and I could not but lament that it went so far beyond all bounds, that even the fragments cannot be communicated.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-06_p4" title="v12_1831-03-06_p4"><!--pagestartoriginal-527--><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> read me the list of the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, which nearly filled three pages, and were about a hundred in number. There were all the nicknames imaginable; some of them so comic and ludicrous, that we could not help laughing at them. Many referred to bodily defects, and distinguished a figure so that it came like life before the eye; others indicated the most various follies and vices, and afforded a deep look into the breadth of the immoral world. Had the piece been finished, people must have admired the invention that could combine such various symbolical figures in one single action.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-06_p5" title="v12_1831-03-06_p5">&ldquo;It was not to be imagined that I could finish the piece,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>; &ldquo;for it demanded a high degree of wanton daring, which I had at moments, but which did not in fact lie in the serious tenor of my nature, and on which I could not depend.

Hence, religious worship cannot dispense with it; it is one of the chief means of working upon men miraculously. Thus the D&aelig;monic loves to throw itself into significant individuals, especially when they are in high places, like Frederic and Peter the Great.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-08_p6" title="v12_1831-03-08_p6"><!--pagestartoriginal-528-->&ldquo;Our late Grand Duke had it to such a degree, that nobody could resist him. He had an attractive influence upon men by his mere tranquil presence, without needing even to show himself good-humoured and friendly. All that I undertook by his advice succeeded; so that, in cases where my own understanding and reason were insufficient, I needed only to ask him what was to be done, when he gave me an answer instinctively, and I could always be sure of happy results.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-08_p7" title="v12_1831-03-08_p7">&ldquo;He would have been enviable indeed if he could have possessed himself of my ideas and higher strivings; for when the d&aelig;monic spirit forsook him, and only the human was left, he knew not how to set to work, and was much troubled at it.</p>

This information gave evident pleasure to <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, who has at heart the further prosperity of the theatre.</p>

<p id="v3s_1831-03-10_p2" title="v3s_1831-03-10_p2">I had then to consult him concerning a commission of another kind. It is the intention of the Grand Duchess to invite to <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Weimar</span> the best German author of the present time, provided he is without employment or fortune, and merely lives on the fruits of his talent, and to provide a sinecure place for him, so that he may find leisure to allow all his works to attain the utmost perfection, and not be in the piteous case of working hastily from necessity, to the prejudice of his own talent and of literature.</p>

<p id="v3s_1831-03-10_p3" title="v3s_1831-03-10_p3"><!--pagestartoriginal-531-->&ldquo;The intention of the Grand Duchess,&rdquo; returned <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;is most princely, and I bow before her noble views; but it will be very difficult to make a proper choice. The most distinguished of our present men of genius are already in easy circumstances, through state employment, pensions, and their own private resources. Besides, every one would not suit here, and every one would not be really assisted by coming. I will, however, bear the noble design in mind, and see what good the next year may bring us.&rdquo;</p></div>

Thus, in &lsquo;Ivanhoe,&rsquo; there is a scene where they are seated at a table in a castle-hall, at night, and a stranger enters. Now, he is quite right in describing the stranger's appearance and dress, but it is a fault that he goes to the length of describing his feet, shoes, and stockings. When we sit down in the evening, and some one comes in, we see only the upper part of his body. If I describe the feet, daylight enters at once, and the scene loses its nocturnal character.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-15_p2" title="v12_1831-03-15_p2">The second, fourth, and fifth books may be deemed complete, with the exception of some trifles that can easily be settled in a final revision.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-15_p3" title="v12_1831-03-15_p3">Here followed some remarks on the first and third books:&mdash;</p>

I therefore suggest that it should terminate the first book, in order that a kind of pause may be produced.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-15_p5" title="v12_1831-03-15_p5">The pretty anecdotes of the fire in the <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Judengasse</span> (Jew's lane), and the skating in the mother's red velvet cloak, which are now at the end of the first book, and are not rightly placed there, should properly be connected with the portion which treats of unconscious, unpremeditated poetic production. For those events refer to a similarly happy state of mind, which, once in action, does not long think and ask what is to be done, but has already acted before the thought comes.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-15_p9" title="v12_1831-03-15_p9">Dined with the Prince and <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">M. Soret</span>. We talked a great deal about <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Courier</span>, and then about the conclusion of <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>'s &ldquo;Novel,&rdquo; when I made the remark that in that work import and art stood too high for people to know what to make of it. They like to hear and see over and over again what they have seen and heard already; and as they are accustomed to find the flower Poetry in thoroughly poetical fields, they are amazed when they see it springing from a thoroughly real soil. In the poetical region people will put up with anything, and no wonder is too great for belief; but here, in the broad light of real day, they are startled by the slightest deviation from the ordinary course of things. Being surrounded by a thousand wonders to which we are accustomed, we are troubled at a single one which has hitherto been new. Again, mankind finds no difficulty in believing the wonders of an earlier period, but to give a sort of actuality to a wonder that happens to-day, and to know it is a higher reality by the side of that which is visibly real,&mdash;this does not seem to lie in human capacity, or, if it does, it seems to have been expelled by education. Our age will hence become more and more prosaic, and, with the exception of faith in the supernatural, all poetry will gradually disappear.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-15_p10" title="v12_1831-03-15_p10">As a conclusion to <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>'s &ldquo;Novel,&rdquo; nothing is required but the feeling that man is not quite deserted by higher beings, but that, on the contrary, they keep their eye on him, sympathize with him, and, in case of need, come to his assistance.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-15_p11" title="v12_1831-03-15_p11">There is something so natural in this belief, that it belongs to man, is a constituent part of his being, and is innate with all nations, as the foundation of all religion. In the first human beginnings, it appears strong; but it does not yield to the highest culture, so that we find it still great in Plato, and, last of all, just as brilliant in the author of &ldquo;Daphnis and Chloe.&rdquo; In this charming poem, the Divine operates under the form of Pan and the nymphs, who take an interest in pious shepherds and <!--pagestartoriginal-534-->lovers, save and protect them in the daytime, appear to them in dreams at night, and tell them what is to be done. In <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>'s &ldquo;Novel,&rdquo; this Invisible Guardian is conceived under the form of the Eternal and the Angels, who once, in a den, amid fierce lions, guarded the prophet, and who here, in the presence of a similar monster, afford their protection to a good child. The lion does not tear the boy to pieces, but rather appears mild and docile; for those higher beings who have been active through all eternity participate in the affair.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-15_p12" title="v12_1831-03-15_p12">But that this may not appear too marvellous to an incredulous nineteenth century, the poet makes use of a second powerful motive, namely, that of music, the magic power of which has been felt by mankind from the earliest times, and by which we allow ourselves to be governed every day, without knowing how it happens.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-15_p13" title="v12_1831-03-15_p13">And as Orpheus by this magic drew after him all the beasts of the forest, and as in the last Greek poem a young shepherd leads goats with his flute, so that to different melodies they disperse and assemble, fly from the enemy and graze in quiet, so in <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>'s &ldquo;Novel&rdquo; does music exercise its power on the lion, inasmuch as the violent beast yields to the melodies of the dulcet flute, and follows whithersoever he is led by the innocence of the boy.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-15_p14" title="v12_1831-03-15_p14">When I have spoken with divers people about such inexplicable things, I have observed that man is so deeply impressed with his excellent qualities, that he does not hesitate to endow the gods with them, but cannot easily resolve to give a part of them to brutes.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-18_p2" title="v12_1831-03-18_p2">We spoke of higher maxims, whether it was good or possible to communicate them to others. &ldquo;The capacity of apprehending what is high,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;is very rare; and therefore, in common life, a man does well to keep such things for himself, and only to give out so much as is needful to have some advantage against others.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-18_p3" title="v12_1831-03-18_p3">We touched upon the point that many men, especially critics and poets, wholly ignore true greatness, while they assign an extraordinary value to mediocrity.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-18_p5" title="v12_1831-03-18_p5">I noted this that I might know how to think of such a practice in future.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-18_p6" title="v12_1831-03-18_p6">We then spoke of the &ldquo;Theory of Colours,&rdquo; and of certain German professors who continue to warn their pupils against it as a great error.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-18_p8" title="v12_1831-03-18_p8"><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> then told me that he was making good progress with his new edition of the &ldquo;Metamorphosis of Plants,&rdquo; and <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Soret</span>'s translation, which was more and more felicitous.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-18_p9" title="v12_1831-03-18_p9">&ldquo;It will be a remarkable book,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;inasmuch as the most varied elements are worked up into one whole. I have inserted some passages from some important young German naturalists, and it is pleasing to see that such a good style has been formed among the better writers in Germany, that we cannot tell whether one or the other is speaking. However, the book gives me more trouble than I thought, and I was at first led into the undertaking almost against myself, but something D&aelig;monic prevailed, which was not to be resisted.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-18_p10" title="v12_1831-03-18_p10"><!--pagestartoriginal-536-->&ldquo;You did well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in yielding to such influences, for the D&aelig;monic seems to be of such a powerful nature, that it is sure to carry its point at last.&rdquo;</p>

Such matters are in the same predicament as the game which the French call <i><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">codille</span></i>, where a great deal is decided by the dice which are thrown, but where it is left to the skill of the player to place the men well on the board.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-20_p2" title="v12_1831-03-20_p2">&ldquo;The book,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is so beautiful, that, amid the bad circumstances in which we live, we cannot retain the impression we receive from it, but are astonished anew every time we read it. The clearest day prevails in it, and we think we are looking at nothing but Herculanean pictures, while these paintings react upon the book, and assist our fancy as we read.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-20_p3" title="v12_1831-03-20_p3">&ldquo;I was much pleased,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;at a certain isolation in which the whole is placed. There is scarcely a foreign allusion to take us out of those happy regions. Of the deities, Pan and the nymphs are alone active, and other is scarcely named, and still we see that these are quite enough for the wants of shepherds.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-20_p4" title="v12_1831-03-20_p4">&ldquo;And yet, notwithstanding all this isolation,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;a complete world is developed. We see shepherds of every kind, agriculturists, gardeners, vine-dressers, sailors, robbers, and warriors, besides genteel townsmen, great lords, and serfs.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-20_p5" title="v12_1831-03-20_p5">&ldquo;We also see man,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in all his grades of life, from his birth to his old age; and all the domestic cicumstances which are occasioned by changes of season pass before our eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-20_p6" title="v12_1831-03-20_p6">&ldquo;Then the landscape,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>,&mdash;&ldquo;how clearly is it given with a few touches! We can see, rising behind the persons, vineyards, fields, and orchards; below, the <!--pagestartoriginal-537-->meadow and the stream; and, in the distance, the broad sea. Then there is not a trace of gloomy days, of mists, clouds, and damp, but always the clearest bluest sky, a charming air and the driest soil, so that one would readily stretch one's naked limbs anywhere.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-20_p7" title="v12_1831-03-20_p7">&ldquo;The whole <a href="#v12_1831-03-20_n1" id="v12_1831-03-20_a1" title="vol1/2 1831-03-20 note 1">poem,&rdquo;<sup>[1]</sup></a> continued <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;shows the highest art and cultivation. It has been so well considered, that not a motive is wanting, but all are of the best and most substantial kind; as, for instance, that of the treasure near the dolphin on the shore. Then there is a taste, and a perfection, and a delicacy of feeling, which cannot be excelled. Everything that is repulsive and disturbs from without the happy condition which the poem expresses&mdash;such as invasion, robbery, and war&mdash;is got rid of as quickly as possible, so that scarcely a trace of it is left. Then vice appears in the train of the townsmen, and there not in the principal characters, but in a subordinate personage. All this is of the highest beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-20_p8" title="v12_1831-03-20_p8">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I was much pleased to see how well the relation between master and servant is expressed. On the one hand, there is the kindest treatment; on the other, in spite of all na&iuml;ve freedom, great respect and an endeavour to gain, in any way, the favour of the master. Thus the young townsman, who has rendered himself odious to Daphnis, endeavours, when the latter is recognized as his master's son, to regain his favour by boldly rescuing Chloe from the cowherds, and bringing her back to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-20_p9" title="v12_1831-03-20_p9">&ldquo;All these things,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;show great understanding; it is excellent also that Chloe preserves her innocence to the end,&mdash;and the motives for this are so well contrived, that the greatest human affairs are brought under notice. One must write a whole book properly to estimate all the great merits of this poem, and one would do well to read it every year, to be instructed by it again and again, and to receive anew the impression of its great beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-21_p7" title="v12_1831-03-21_p7">We then spoke of <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Courier</span>'s own works,&mdash;of his little fugitive pieces, and the defence of the famous ink-spot on the manuscript at Florence.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-21_p9" title="v12_1831-03-21_p9">We spoke of the difference between the German notion of <i><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Geist</span></i>, and the French <i><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Esprit</span></i>.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-21_p10" title="v12_1831-03-21_p10">&ldquo;The French <i><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Esprit</span></i>,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;means nearly the same with our German word <i><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Witz</span></i>.

And what knowledge! what a power of language! We look into a great animated world, where one constantly stimulated another, and mind and character were kept in such constant exercise, that both must be flexible and strong. But it seems to me quite extraordinary to see what men the French had in their literature in the last century. I am astonished when I only look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-21_p14" title="v12_1831-03-21_p14">&ldquo;It was the metamorphosis of a hundred-year-old literature,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;which had been growing ever since <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Louis</span> XIV., and stood now in full flower.

Some German artists appeared there with long hair, moustachios, shirt-<!--pagestartoriginal-540-->collars turned over on old-fashioned German coats, tobacco-pipes, and bull-dogs. They do not seem to visit Rome for the sake of the great masters, or to learn anything. To them Raphael seems weak, and Titian merely a good colourist.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-22_p3" title="v12_1831-03-22_p3">Our young friend then gave an account of the carnival, the election of the new pope, and the revolution which broke out immediately after.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-22_p5" title="v12_1831-03-22_p5">We discussed the question whether the errors now perceptible in some young German artists had proceeded from individuals, and spread abroad by intellectual contagion, or whether they had their origin in the general tendency of the time.</p>

The doctrine was, that the artist chiefly needs piety and genius to be equal to the best. Such a doctrine was very flattering, and was eagerly snatched up. For, to become pious, a man need learn nothing, and genius each one inherited from his mother. One need only utter something that flatters indolence and conceit, to be sure of plenty of adherents among commonplace people.&rdquo;</p></div>

We talked of the Grand Duchess; how she is quietly at work in all directions, doing good, and making the hearts of all her subjects her own.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-27_p3" title="v12_1831-03-27_p3">&ldquo;The Grand Duchess,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;has as much intellect and sweetness as good-will; she is a true blessing to the country. And as men are everywhere quick to feel whence they receive benefits, worshipping the sun and kindly elements, I wonder not that all hearts turn to her with love, and that she is speedily appreciated, as she deserves to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-27_p4" title="v12_1831-03-27_p4">I mentioned that I had begun &ldquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Minna von Barnhelm</span>&rdquo; with the Prince, and observed how excellent this piece appeared to me.</p>

Truly it was a glittering meteor. It taught us to perceive that there was something higher than that of which the weak literary epoch gave any notion. The first two acts are a model in the art of introduction; from which much has been learned, and much may be learned still. Nowadays, indeed, writers are not curious about this art: the effect, which was once expected in the third act, they will now have in the first scene: and they do not reflect that it is with poetry as with going to sea, where we should push from the shore, and reach a certain elevation before we unfurl all our sails.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-27_p7" title="v12_1831-03-27_p7"><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> had some excellent Rhine wine brought, which had been sent by his Frankfort friends, as a present, on his last birthday.

<p id="v12_1831-03-27_p9" title="v12_1831-03-27_p9">&ldquo;All <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Merck</span>'s tauntings, no doubt, proceeded from a high state of culture; only, as he was not productive, but had, on the contrary, a decidedly negative tendency, he was ever more inclined to blame than praise, and was involuntarily always seeking for means to gratify this inclination.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-27_p10" title="v12_1831-03-27_p10">We talked of <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Vogel</span>, and his ministerial talents; of <span title="Gille">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and his character.</p>

I may almost say that I find it <!--pagestartoriginal-543-->enviable to be allowed, at my advanced age, to write the history of my youth, and to describe an epoch which is, in many respects, of high significance.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-28_p2" title="v12_1831-03-28_p2">We talked over the several particulars, which were present to my mind as well as to his.</p>

The thought of resigning herself to a man was repulsive to her, and we may imagine that this peculiarity caused many unpleasant hours in marriage. Women who have a similar aversion, or do not love their husbands, will feel the force of this. On this account I could never look upon my sister as married; she would have been much more in her place as an abbess in a convent.</p>

But the Germans do not easily understand how to receive anything out of the common course, and what is of a high nature often passes by them without their being aware of it. A fact of our lives is valuable, not so far as it is true, but so far as it is significant.&rdquo;</p></div>

He had not yet completed his &lsquo;Don Carlos;&rsquo; he had just returned from Swabia, and seemed very sick, and in a state of nervous suffering. His face was like the picture of a crucified Christ. <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> thought he could not live a fortnight; but as his situation became more agreeable he grew better, and, indeed, it was not till then that he wrote all his important works.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-03-31_p3" title="v12_1831-03-31_p3"><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Meyer</span> then related some traits of <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Jean Paul</span> and <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Schlegel</span>&mdash;both of whom he had met at a public-house in <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Heidelberg</span>&mdash;and some pleasant reminiscences of his residence in Italy, which entertained us highly.</p>

He showed me a water-colour drawing by <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Herr von Reutern</span>, representing a young peasant, who stands in the market-place of a small town near a female basket-seller. The young man is surveying the baskets, which lie before him, while two females, who are seated, and a stout lass, who stands by them, regard his comely, youthful face with satisfaction. The picture is so prettily composed, and there is such <i><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">na&iuml;vet&eacute;</span></i> and truth in the expression of the figures, that one cannot look at it enough.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-04-01_p2" title="v12_1831-04-01_p2">&ldquo;Water-colour painting,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;is brought to a very high degree in this picture. There are some silly folks who say that <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Herr von Reutern</span> is indebted to no one in his art, but has everything from himself, as if a man could have anything from himself but clumsiness and stupidity. If this artist has had no master so called, he has nevertheless had intercourse with excellent masters, and from these, as well as from great predecessors and ever present nature, he has acquired what he now possesses. Nature has given him an excellent talent, and nature and art together have perfected him. He is excellent, and in many respects unique, but we cannot say that he has everything from <!--pagestartoriginal-547-->himself. Of a thoroughly crazy and defective artist, we may, indeed, say he has everything from himself; but of an excellent one, never.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-04-01_p3" title="v12_1831-04-01_p3"><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> then showed me a work by the same artist, a frame richly painted with gold and various colours, with a place left in the middle for an inscription. At the top there was a building in the Gothic style; rich arabesques, with landscapes and domestic scenes interwoven, ran down the two sides; at the bottom was a pleasant woodland scene, with the freshest grass and foliage.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-04-01_p4" title="v12_1831-04-01_p4">&ldquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Herr von Reutern</span>,&rdquo; says <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;wishes I would write neatly in the blank space; but his frame is such a splendid work of art, that I dread to spoil the picture with my handwriting. I have composed some verses for the purpose, and think it will be better to have them inserted by the hand of a caligrapher. I would then sign them myself. What do you advise in this matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-04-01_p5" title="v12_1831-04-01_p5">&ldquo;If I were <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Herr von Reutern</span>,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I should be grieved to have the poem in the hand of another; happy, if it were written in your own. The painter has displayed art enough in the frame&mdash;none is needed in the writing; it is only important that it should be genuine&mdash;in your own hand. I advise you, too, not to use the Roman, but the German text; for your hand has in that a more peculiar character, and, besides, it harmonizes better with the Gothic design in the frame.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-04-01_p6" title="v12_1831-04-01_p6">&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>; &ldquo;and in the end it will be the shortest way. Perhaps to-day will bring a courageous moment, in which I may venture upon it. But if I make a blot on the beautiful picture,&rdquo; he added, laughing, &ldquo;you shall answer for it.&rdquo;</p>

Objects from all departments of nature are at his com<!--pagestartoriginal-548-->mand; he draws ground, rocks, and trees, as well as men or animals, and, while he lavishes such wealth on slight marginal drawings, he seems to play with his capabilities, and the spectator feels that pleasure which is ever wont to accompany a free, easy libation from abundant means.</p>

He appeared to have had his speech well in his head; for he spoke for a long while with perfect fluency, and without any hesitation. All at once, however, he appeared to be quite forsaken by his good genius; the thread of his thoughts seemed to be cut off, and he appeared quite to have lost the power of grasping what he had further to say. This would have thrown any one else into great embarrassment, but it was not so with him. On the contrary, he looked for at least ten minutes, steadily and quietly, round the circle of his numerous audience, who were so struck by his personal power, that during the very long and almost ridiculous pause, every one remained perfectly quiet. At last he appeared to have again become master of his subject; he went on with his speech, and, without hesitation, continued it very ably to the end, as unembarrassed and serene as if nothing had happened.&rdquo;</p></div>

After much cheerful discourse he at last turned the conversation to his personal affairs, by rising and taking from his desk a written paper.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p2" title="v12_1831-05-15_p2">&ldquo;When one, like myself,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has passed the age of eighty, one has hardly a right to live, but ought each day to hold oneself ready to be called away, and think of setting one's house in order. I have, as I lately told you appointed you in my will editor of my literary remains, and have this morning drawn up, as a sort of contract, a little paper, which I wish you to sign with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p3" title="v12_1831-05-15_p3">With these words, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> placed before me the paper, in which I found mentioned by name the works, both finished and unfinished, which were to be published after his death. I had come to an understanding with him upon essentials, and we both signed the contract.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p4" title="v12_1831-05-15_p4">The material, which I had already from time to time been busy in revising, I estimated at about fifteen volumes. We then talked of certain matters of detail, which had not been yet decided.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p5" title="v12_1831-05-15_p5">&ldquo;The case may arise,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;that the publisher is unwilling to go beyond a certain number of sheets, and that hence some part of the material must be omitted. In that case, you may omit the polemic part of my &lsquo;Theory of Colours.&rsquo; My peculiar doctrine is contained in the theoretical part; and as the historical part is already of a polemic character, inasmuch as the leading errors of the Newtonian theory are discussed there, you will almost have polemics <!--pagestartoriginal-550-->enough. I by no means disavow my severe dissection of the Newtonian maxims; it was necessary at the time, and will also have its value hereafter; but, at bottom, all polemic action is repugnant to my proper nature, and I can take but little pleasure in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p6" title="v12_1831-05-15_p6">We next talked about the &ldquo;Maxims and Reflections,&rdquo; which had been printed at the end of the second and third volumes of the &ldquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wanderjahre</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p7" title="v12_1831-05-15_p7">When he began to remodel and finish this novel, <a href="#v12_1831-05-15_n1" id="v12_1831-05-15_a1" title="vol1/2 1831-05-15 note 1">which had previously appeared in one volume,<sup>[1]</sup></a> <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> intended to expand it into two, as indeed is expressed in the announcement of the new edition of his entire works. But, as the work progressed, the manuscript grew beyond expectation; and, as his secretary wrote widely, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> was deceived, and thought that he had enough not only for two but for three volumes, and accordingly the manuscript went in three volumes to the publishers. However, when the printing had reached a certain point, it was found that <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> had made a miscalculation, and that the two last volumes especially were too small. They sent for more manuscript, and, as the course of the novel (<i>Roman</i>) could not be altered, and it was impossible to invent, write, and insert a new tale (<i>Novelle</i>) in the hurry of the moment, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> was really in some perplexity.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p8" title="v12_1831-05-15_p8">Under these circumstances he sent for me, told me the state of the case, and mentioned at the same time how he thought to help himself out of the difficulty, laying before me two large bundles of manuscript, which he had caused to be fetched for that purpose.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p9" title="v12_1831-05-15_p9">&ldquo;In these two parcels you will find various papers hitherto unpublished, detached pieces, finished and unfinished, opinions on natural science, art, literature, and life, all mingled together. Suppose you were to make up from these, six or eight printed sheets to fill the gaps in my &lsquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wanderjahre</span>.&rsquo; Strictly speaking, they have nothing to do with it, but the proceeding may be justified by the fact that mention is made of an archive in Makaria's house, in <!--pagestartoriginal-551-->which such detached pieces are preserved. Thus we shall not only get over a great difficulty for the moment, but find a fitting vehicle for sending a number of very interesting things into the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p10" title="v12_1831-05-15_p10">I approved of the plan, set to work at once, and completed the desired arrangement in a short time. <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> seemed well satisfied. I had put together the whole in two principal parts, one under the title&mdash;&ldquo;From Makaria's Archive;&rdquo; the other under the head&mdash;&ldquo;According to the Views of the Wanderer.&rdquo; And as <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, at this time, had just finished two important poems, one&mdash;&ldquo;On <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Schiller</span>'s Skull,&rdquo; and the other&mdash;&ldquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kein Wesen kann zu nichts zerfallen</span>&rdquo; (No being can fall away to nothing), he was desirous to bring out these also, and we added them at the close of the two divisions.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p11" title="v12_1831-05-15_p11">But when the &ldquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wanderjahre</span>&rdquo; came out, no one knew what to make of it. The progress of the romance was seen to be interrupted by a number of enigmatical sayings, the explanation of which could be expected only from men of certain departments, such as artists, literati, and natural philosophers, and which greatly annoyed all other readers, especially those of the fair sex. Then, as for the two poems, people could as little understand them as they could guess how they got into such a place. <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> laughed at this.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p12" title="v12_1831-05-15_p12">&ldquo;What is done, is done,&rdquo; said he to-day, &ldquo;and all you have to do is, when you edit my literary remains, to insert these things in their proper places, so that when my works are republished, they may be distributed in proper order, and the &lsquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wanderjahre</span>&rsquo; may be reduced to two volumes, according to the original intention.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-05-15_p13" title="v12_1831-05-15_p13">We agreed that I should hereafter arrange all the aphorisms relating to Art in a volume on subjects of art, all relating to Nature in a volume on natural science in general, and all the ethical and literary maxims in a volume likewise adapted for them.</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-06-20_p1" title="v3e_1831-06-20_p1" class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">This</span> afternoon a short half hour at <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>'s, whom I found still at dinner.</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-06-20_p2" title="v3e_1831-06-20_p2">We conversed upon some subjects of natural science; particularly upon the imperfection and insufficiency of language, by which errors and false views which afterwards could not easily be overcome were spread abroad. &ldquo;The case is simply this,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>. &ldquo;All languages have arisen from surrounding human necessities, human occupations, and the general feelings and views of man. If, now, a superior man gains an insight into the secret operations of nature, the language which has been handed down to him is not sufficient to express anything so remote from human affairs. He ought to have at command the language of spirits to express adequately his peculiar perceptions. But as this is not the case, he must, in his views of the extraordinary in nature, always grasp at human expressions, with which he almost always falls too short, lowering his subject, or even injuring and destroying it.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-06-20_p3" title="v3e_1831-06-20_p3">&ldquo;If <i>you</i> say this,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you who always pursue your subjects very closely, and, as an enemy to phrases, can always find the most fitting expressions for your higher perceptions, there is something in it. But I should have thought that, generally, we Germans might be contented. Our language is so extraordinarily rich, elaborated, and capable of progress, that even if we are obliged sometimes to have recourse to a trope, we can still arrive pretty nearly at the proper expression. The French are at a great disadvantage when compared with us. With them the expression for some higher view of nature by a trope, generally borrowed from a technicality, is at once material and vulgar, so that it is by no means adequate to a higher view.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-06-20_p4" title="v3e_1831-06-20_p4">&ldquo;How right you are,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;has appeared to me lately, on the occasion of the dispute between <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cuvier</span> and Geoffrey <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de St. Hilaire</span>. Geoffrey <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de St. Hilaire</span> is a man who has certainly a great insight into the spiritual workings of nature; but his French language, so far as he is constrained to use traditional expressions, leaves him quite in the lurch. And this not only in mysteriously spiritual, but also in visible, purely corporeal subjects and relations. If he would express the single parts of an <!--pagestartoriginal-556-->organic being, he has no other word but <i><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">materialien</span></i>: thus, for instance, the bones, which, as homogeneous parts, form the organic whole of an arm, are placed upon the same scale of expression as the stones and planks with which a house is built.</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-06-20_p5" title="v3e_1831-06-20_p5">&ldquo;In the same inappropriate manner,&rdquo; continued <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;the French use the expression <i>composition</i>, in speaking of the productions of nature. I can certainly put together the individual parts of a machine made of separate pieces, and, upon such a subject, speak of a composition; but not when I have in my mind the individual parts of an organic whole, which produce themselves with life, and are pervaded by a common soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-06-20_p6" title="v3e_1831-06-20_p6">&ldquo;It appears to me,&rdquo; added I, &ldquo;that the expression <i>composition</i> is also inappropriate and degrading to genuine productions of art and poetry.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-06-20_p7" title="v3e_1831-06-20_p7">&ldquo;It is a thoroughly contemptible word,&rdquo; returned <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;for which we have to thank the French, and of which we should endeavour to rid ourselves as soon as possible. How can one say, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Mozart</span> has <i>composed</i> (<i><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">componirt</span></i>) Don Juan! Composition! As if it were a piece of cake or biscuit, which had been stirred together out of eggs, flour, and sugar! It is a spiritual creation, in which the details, as well as the whole, are pervaded by <i>one</i> spirit, and by the breath of <i>one</i> life; so that the producer did not make experiments, and patch together, and follow his own caprice, but was altogether in the power of the d&aelig;monic spirit of his genius, and acted according to his orders.&rdquo;</p></div>

I have lately been reading his &lsquo;<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Notre Dame de Paris</span>,&rsquo; and required no little patience to support the horror with which this reading has inspired me. It is the most abominable book that ever was written! Besides, one is not even indemnified for the torture one has to endure by the pleasure one might receive from a truthful representation of human nature or human character.

He spoke of various things, at last of Carlsbad; and he joked about the various love affairs which he had experienced there. &ldquo;A little passion,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the only thing which can render a watering-place supportable; without it, one dies of ennui. I was almost always lucky enough to find there some little &lsquo;elective affinity&rsquo; (<i><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wahlverwandtschaft</span></i>), which entertained me during the few weeks. I recollect one circumstance in particular, which even now gives me pleasure.</p>

<p id="v3s_1831-07-20_p2" title="v3s_1831-07-20_p2">&ldquo;I one day visited <i>Frau von Reck</i>. After a commonplace chat, I had taken my leave, and met, as I went out, a lady with two very pretty young girls. &lsquo;Who was that gentleman who just now left you?&rsquo; asked the lady. &lsquo;It was <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>,&rsquo; answered Frau von Reck. &lsquo;Oh, how I regret,&rsquo; returned the lady, &lsquo;that he did not stay, and that I have <!--pagestartoriginal-558-->not had the happiness of making his acquaintance!&rsquo; &lsquo;You have lost nothing by it, my dear,&rsquo; said Frau von Reck. &lsquo;He is very dull amongst ladies, unless they are pretty enough to inspire him with some interest. Ladies of our age must not expect to make him talkative or amiable.&rsquo;</p>

<p id="v3s_1831-07-20_p3" title="v3s_1831-07-20_p3">&ldquo;When the two young ladies left the house with their mother, they thought of Frau von Reck's words. &lsquo;We are young, we are pretty,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;let us see if we cannot succeed in captivating and taming this renowned savage!&rsquo; The next morning, on the promenade by the <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Sprudel</span>, they made me, in passing, the most graceful and amiable salutations, and I could not forbear taking the opportunity of approaching and accosting them. They were charming! I spoke to them again and again, they led me to their mother, and so I was caught. From that time we saw each other daily, nay, we spent whole days together. In order to make our connection more intimate, it happened that the betrothed of the one arrived, when I devoted myself more exclusively to the other. I was also very amiable to the mother, as may be imagined; in fact, we were all thoroughly pleased with one another, and I spent so many happy days with this family, that the recollection of them is even now highly agreeable. The two girls soon related to me the conversation between their mother and Frau von Reck, describing the conspiracy which they had contrived for my conquest, and brought to a fortunate issue.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3s_1831-07-20_p4" title="v3s_1831-07-20_p4">An anecdote of another kind occurs to me, which <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> had related to me before, but which may find a place here.</p>

I cannot name either the lady or the gentleman; but that is not to the purpose. They conversed and appeared to think of nothing,&mdash;when, suddenly, their heads inclined towards each other, and they exchanged a hearty kiss. They then resumed their former direction, and continued their conversation as if nothing had happened. &lsquo;Did you see it?&rsquo; exclaimed my friend, full of astonish<!--pagestartoriginal-559-->ment; &lsquo;may I believe my eyes?&rsquo; &lsquo;I did see it,&rsquo; returned I, quietly, &lsquo;but I do not believe it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p id="v3e_1831-12-01_p2" title="v3e_1831-12-01_p2">&ldquo;I have lately been reading a very pretty poem of his,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;a trilogy,&mdash;the first two parts of which possess an agreeable rusticity, but the last, under the title &lsquo;Midnight,&rsquo; bears a sombre character. In this &lsquo;Midnight&rsquo; he has succeeded. In reading it, one actually breathes the breath of night; almost as in the pictures of <span xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">Rembrandt</span>, in which one also seems to feel the night-air. <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Victor Hugo</span> has treated similar subjects, but not with such felicity. In the nocturnal scenes of this indisputably great man, it is never actually night; on the contrary, the subjects remain always as distinct and visible as if it were still day, and the represented night were merely a deception. <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Soret</span> has, unquestionably, surpassed the renowned <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Victor Hugo</span> in his &lsquo;Midnight.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-12-01_p3" title="v3e_1831-12-01_p3">I was pleased at this commendation, and resolved to read the said trilogy, by <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Soret</span>, as soon as possible. &ldquo;We possess, in our literature, very few trilogies,&rdquo; remarked I.</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-12-01_p4" title="v3e_1831-12-01_p4">&ldquo;This form,&rdquo; returned <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;is very rare amongst the moderns generally. It sometimes happens that one <!--pagestartoriginal-560-->finds a subject which seems naturally to demand a treatment in three parts; so that in the first there is a sort of introduction, in the second a sort of catastrophe, and in the third a satisfying denouement. In my poem of &lsquo;The Youth and the Fair Miller&rsquo; these requisites are found, although when I wrote it I by no means thought of making a trilogy. My &lsquo;Paria,&rsquo; also, is a perfect trilogy; and, indeed, it was a trilogy that I intentionally treated this cycle. My &lsquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Trilogie der Leidenschaft</span>&rsquo; (Trilogy of Passion), as it is called, was, on the contrary, not originally conceived as a trilogy, but became a trilogy gradually, and to a certain extent incidentally. At first, as you know, I had merely the elegy, as an independent poem. Then Madame <span xml:lang="pl" lang="pl">Szymanowska</span>, who had been at Marienbad with me that summer, visited me, and, by her charming melodies, awoke in me the echo of those youthful happy days. The strophes which I dedicated to this fair friend are therefore written quite in the metre and tone of the elegy, and suit very well as a satisfactory conclusion. Then Weygand wished to prepare a new edition of my &lsquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Werther</span>,&rsquo; and asked me for a preface; which to me was a very welcome occasion to write &lsquo;My poem to <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Werther</span>.&rsquo; But as I had still a remnant of that passion in my heart, the poem as it were formed itself into an introduction to the elegy. Thus it happened that all three poems which now stand together are pervaded by the same love-sick feeling; and the &lsquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Trilogie der Leidenschaft</span>&rsquo; formed itself I knew not how.</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-12-01_p5" title="v3e_1831-12-01_p5">&ldquo;I have advised <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Soret</span> to write more trilogies, and, indeed he should do it as I have described. He should not take the trouble to seek a particular subject for a trilogy, but should rather select, from the rich store of his unprinted poems, one that is especially pregnant with meaning, and, when occasion offers, add a sort of introduction, and conclusion, yet still so that the three productions are separated by a perceptible gap. In this manner one attains one's end far more easily, and spares oneself much thinking, which is notoriously, as <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Meyer</span> says, a very difficult thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-12-01_p6" title="v3e_1831-12-01_p6">We then spoke of <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Victor Hugo</span>, remarking that his too great fertility had been highly prejudicial to his talent.</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-12-01_p7" title="v3e_1831-12-01_p7">&ldquo;How can a writer help growing worse, and destroying <!--pagestartoriginal-561-->the finest talent in the world,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;if he has the audacity to write in a single year two tragedies and a novel; and further, when he only appears to work in order to scrape together immense sums of money. I do not blame him for trying to become rich, and to earn present renown; but if he intends to live long in futurity, he must begin to write less and to work more.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v3e_1831-12-01_p8" title="v3e_1831-12-01_p8"><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> then went through &ldquo;Marie de Lorme,&rdquo; and endeavoured to make it clear to me that the subject only contained sufficient material to make one single good and really tragical act; but that the author had allowed himself, by considerations of quite a secondary nature, to be misled into stretching out his subject to five long acts. &ldquo;Under these circumstances,&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;we have merely the advantage of seeing that the poet is great in the representation of details, which certainly is something, and that no trifle.&rdquo;</p></div>

 <h3><i>Wed</i>., <i>Dec</i>. 21.</h3>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p1" title="v12_1831-12-21_p1" class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Dined</span> with <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>. We talked of the reason why his &ldquo;Theory of Colours&rdquo; had been so little diffused.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p2" title="v12_1831-12-21_p2">&ldquo;It is very hard to communicate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for, as you know, it requires not only to be read and studied, but to be <i>done</i>, and this is difficult. The laws of poetry and painting may likewise be communicated to a certain extent; but to be a good poet and painter genius is required, which is not to be communicated. To receive a simple, primitive phenomenon, to recognize it in its high significance, and to go to work with it, requires a productive spirit, which is able to take a wide survey, and is a rare gift, only to be found in very superior natures.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p3" title="v12_1831-12-21_p3">&ldquo;And even this is not enough. For, as with every rule, and with all genius, one is yet no painter, but still requires uninterrupted practice, so with the &lsquo;Theory of Colours&rsquo; it is not enough for one to know the chief laws and have a suitable mind, but it is necessary to occupy oneself constantly with the several single phenomena, which are often very mysterious, and with their deductions and combinations.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p4" title="v12_1831-12-21_p4">&ldquo;Thus, for instance, we know well enough the general proposition that a green colour is produced by a mixture of yellow and blue; but before a person can say that he com<!--pagestartoriginal-562 -->prehends the green of the rainbow, or of foliage, or of sea-water, there will be requisite a thorough investigation of the whole region of colour, with a consequent acme of acuteness, which scarcely any one has yet attained.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p5" title="v12_1831-12-21_p5">After dinner, we looked at some landscapes by <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Poussin</span>.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p6" title="v12_1831-12-21_p6">&ldquo;Those places,&rdquo; observed <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;on which the painter throws the principal light, do not admit of detail in the execution; and therefore water, masses of rock, bare ground, and buildings, are most suitable subjects to bear the principal light. Things, on the contrary, which require more detail in the drawing cannot well be used by the artist in those light places.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p7" title="v12_1831-12-21_p7">&ldquo;A landscape painter,&rdquo; continued <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>, &ldquo;should possess various sorts of knowledge. It is not enough for him to understand perspective, architecture, and the anatomy of men and animals; he must also have some insight into botany and mineralogy, that he may know how to express properly the characteristics of trees, plants, and the character of the different sorts of mountains. It is not, indeed, necessary that he should be an accomplished mineralogist, since he has to do chiefly with lime, slate and sandstone mountains, and only needs know in what forms they lie, how they are acted upon by the atmosphere, and what sort of trees thrive, and are stunted upon them.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p8" title="v12_1831-12-21_p8">He showed me then some landscapes, by <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hermann von Schwanefeld</span>, making various remarks upon the art and personality of that eminent man.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p9" title="v12_1831-12-21_p9">&ldquo;We find in him,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;art and inclination more completely identified than in any other. He has a deep love for nature, and a divine tranquillity, which communicates itself to us when we look upon his pictures. He was born in the Netherlands, and studied at Rome, under <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Claude Lorraine</span>. On this master he formed himself to the highest degree of perfection, and developed his fine capacities in the freest manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p10" title="v12_1831-12-21_p10">We looked into an &ldquo;Artist's Lexicon,&rdquo; to see what was said of <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hermann von Schwanefeld</span>, and found him censured for not equalling his master.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p11" title="v12_1831-12-21_p11">&ldquo;The fools!&rdquo; said <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span>; &ldquo;<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Von Schwanefeld</span> was a different man from <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Claude Lorraine</span>, and the latter could not boast of being the better of the two. If there <!--pagestartoriginal-563-->were nothing more in one's life than is told by our biographers and lexicon writers, it would be a bad business, not worth the trouble it costs.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="break">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p12" title="v12_1831-12-21_p12">At the close of this, and in the beginning of the next year, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goethe</span> turned again to his favourite studies, the natural sciences. At the suggestion of <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boisser&eacute;e</span>, he occupied himself with deeper inquiries into the laws of the rainbow; and also, from sympathy with the dispute between <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cuvier</span> and <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">St. Hilaire</span>, with subjects referring to the metamorphoses of the plant and animal world. He, likewise, revised with me the historical part of the &ldquo;Theory of Colours,&rdquo; taking also lively interest in a chapter on the blending of colours, which I, by his desire, was arranging to be inserted in the theoretical volume.</p>

<p id="v12_1831-12-21_p13" title="v12_1831-12-21_p13">During this time, there was no lack of interesting conversation between us, or of valuable utterances on his side. But, as he was daily before my eyes, fresh and energetic as ever, I fancied this must always be the case, and was too careless of recording his words till it was too late, and, on the 22nd March, 1832, I, with thousands of noble Germans, had to weep for his irreparable loss.</p></div>
