      <p id="description-p0">This is a blog-alternative: a series of informal notes of various ideas, averaging about 300 words each.</p>

      <p id="description-p1">The most common topic is (somewhat speculative) thinking about software engineering. It is not really time-oriented &ndash; the latest entry is not especially important, so scroll through the list of summaries and read any one.</p>

         </dt>
         <dd>Bitcoin is like a steam-powered horseshoe, or an electronic typewriter: it is a contrafunctory overlap of two different eras. It distracts from inventing new info-tech and solving manifest problems.</dd>

            <a href="note-hxa7241-20161030T1229Z.html">What is hard in economic calculation? &ndash; 2016-10-30T12:29Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>The reason a computationally automated, or rather assisted, economy is currently infeasible is because we lack sufficient AI capability for general &lsquo;similarity-finding&rsquo; (similizesis). It is not, as commonly opined, that the required calculation or communication is intractable.</dd>

         </dt>
         <dd>Programming languages can be classified into two well-known naming schemes (tacit, and non-), but from there one can see a third &ndash; naming from intrinsic structure &ndash; which seems interesting and underexplored.</dd>

         </dt>
         <dd>Cooperative systems must be ambivalent, therefore they must be multi-dimensional. Prices are only unidimensional, therefore price-systems alone must be inadequate.</dd>

         </dt>
         <dd>Why have objects? They are &lsquo;naturally arising&rsquo;: components are necessary, callbacks are valuable, and grouping them is good &ndash; and there is an object.</dd>

         <dd>Some epistemology of software correctness &ndash; the underlying method seems to be repetition.</dd>

         </dt>
         <dd>The &lsquo;flatness&rsquo; of the internet just makes it even more subject to be shaped by the inevitable non-flatness of our uses of it.</dd>

            <a href="note-hxa7241-20141231T1101Z.html">TADIST file naming pattern &ndash; 2014-12-31T11:01Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>How should you name user-content files? Here is a possible way: a simple formalised pattern that seems to work for various things.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20140330T1114Z.html">Software's essential form, and visual programming &ndash; 2014-03-30T11:14Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>Text fits software's essential form. And any kind of visual programming will still have a similar kind of structure. We can do better than text, but it seems not a lot better.</dd>

            <a href="note-hxa7241-20140119T1238Z.html">Post-Currencyism 3: Security &ndash; 2014-01-19T12:38Z</a>

         </dt>
         <dd>But does this make sense as an economic mechanism? How can it allocate without currency?</dd>

         </dt>
         <dd>&lsquo;Boolean-blindness&rsquo; is not really about booleans, it is about destructuring data into types, and hence the virtue of a good type system.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20130804T0939Z.html">Testing vs proof in software development &ndash; 2013-08-04T09:39Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>Is proof better than testing? On examination it seems they are not quite comparable, and the key issues are other things: inference and judgement. Development needs both. Perhaps ideally fused into &lsquo;inferential construction&rsquo;.</dd>

            <a href="note-hxa7241-20130707T0900Z.html">Programming language docs structure &ndash; 2013-07-07T09:00Z</a>

         </dt>
         <dd>Is persuasion moral? Only, it seems, in a strictly limited sense. And that leads to an informational problem of how to know when it is.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20130609T0917Z.html">Rule-following and software development &ndash; 2013-06-09T09:17Z</a>

         </dt>
         <dd>De-focus from currency; orient with independent knowledge; imagine cellular automata; base on supply and demand; think in software; discretise, distribute.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20130127T1124Z.html">GITI &ndash; Electric guitar music text format &ndash; 2013-01-27T11:24Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>GITI is a new music text notation for electric guitar: a bit like a specialised kind of <i>abc</i> (another non-traditional notation)</dd>

            <a href="note-hxa7241-20130120T1053Z.html">Debt is a bad cooperative structure &ndash; 2013-01-20T10:53Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>When you look at debt as an abstract informational/cooperative structure you find it is a dysfunctional one. And a quick check for any rational moral basis turns up nothing either. Debt is unwise and we should stop doing it.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20130113T1107Z.html">SBNF &ndash; BNF in S-Exprs &ndash; 2013-01-13T11:07Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>S-Expressions seem particularly well-suited to BNF formulations, giving a simple, regular, and memorable format.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20130106T1019Z.html">Compensation for work is wrong &ndash; 2013-01-06T10:19Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>Compensation is a faulty notion; it does not actually happen, and indeed cannot happen. It is misguided as a basic concept of economic systems.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20121230T1123Z.html">Money definitions are teleological and tautological &ndash; 2012-12-30T11:23Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>The dominant features of thinking about money are teleology and tautology. This is bad both for understanding and coming up with new ideas. We should think of it more computationally.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20120916T0956Z.html">Credit for info-goods &ndash; 2012-09-16T09:56Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>Info-goods should include proper credit/acknowledgement should they not? Maybe that default intention is archaic and narrow, and it is now generally better to decouple description and associate it by hash.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20120909T0926Z.html">Your next project? Design a new economic system! &ndash; 2012-09-09T09:26Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>We are surprisingly close to complete economic revolution. And this is a very interesting thing to ponder and imagine from a software view. Does that seem crazy? The reasoning is, however, straightforward: 1, the economic system works on money; 2, money is really information; 3, information technology is revolutionary.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20120901T1034Z.html">Evolving global software &ndash; 2012-09-01T10:34Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>How should we develop software globally? Is it possible to say what kind of basic process and features, what broad strategies, are preferable? Here are three suggestions.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20120818T0924Z.html">On Pagel's 'Infinite Stupidity', and what new information is &ndash; 2012-08-18T09:24Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>The article &lsquo;Infinite Stupidity&rsquo; makes a novel and interesting point. But it does not quite seem to stand up, and examination of why begins to unravel what information is and where it comes from.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20120708T0907Z.html">Names are wrong, tacit/point-free is right &ndash; 2012-07-08T09:07Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>In software, are names not a curiosity? They are like a mini embedded comment &ndash; nothing else is like that. But furthermore they seem structurally poor too. &lsquo;Tacit-programming&rsquo; is the remedy.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20120624T1124Z.html">Marxist efficiency &ndash; 2012-06-24T11:24Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>Marx's famous slogan of communism, considered purely in itself, seems wholly consistent with the core of (neo-)classical economics, but leads to a much more general perspective.</dd>

            <a href="note-hxa7241-20120513T1116Z.html">Why is information a string of digits? &ndash; 2012-05-13T11:16Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>The fundamental form of information seems to be a string of digits, e.g. DNA, text, bits. Why? This appears to be a peculiarly intriguing question. It is about something apparently very simple, yet it seems somehow profound.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20120506T0907Z.html">Parsing wrongness and language value &ndash; 2012-05-06T09:07Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>Parsing is a poor choice of problem. Programming languages should help us see and help us move.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20120429T1019Z.html">On VPRI STEPS &ndash; 2012-04-29T10:19Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>They seem to be producing a &lsquo;second-draft&rsquo; of current practice, and making some good abstractions, not a revolutionary general technique. Perhaps because <i>no</i> general revolutionary technique seems possible for programming as such.</dd>

         <dt>
            <a href="note-hxa7241-20120508T1121Z.html">Money as a cooperative mechanism &ndash; 2012-05-08T11:21Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>What is money? It is a mechanism that supports/induces a particular framework of cooperation. And it is outdated.</dd>

            <a href="note-hxa7241-20120122T1207Z.html">Comparing natural language and software &ndash; 2012-01-22T12:07Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>Natural language is very different to software, but what is similar? what makes them seem related? They seem to focus on abstractions of different character.</dd>

         </dt>
         <dd>There is a kind of rhetorical trick in copyright theory. The orthodox model appears to give a rational solidity to copyright, but as an argument <i>for</i> it it is unsound, and proves nothing of what it appears to want to.</dd>

            <a href="note-hxa7241-20111113T1241Z.html">Power, predictability, and regularity &ndash; 2011-11-13T12:41Z</a>
         </dt>
         <dd>At the deepest level, software seems to have an essential trade-off of power against predictability. And the problem there is not a matter of conformance but of clarity. That means perhaps the best we can do is design programming languages to have a kind of &lsquo;regularity&rsquo;.</dd>
