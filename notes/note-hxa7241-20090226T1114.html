   <p>Software architecture is about articulating logical structure, but what does that mean more exactly?</p>

   <p>Mere conciousness confers upon almost everything at least some logical properties. Almost everything can be seen and handled in some way discretely and measurably. This aspect is ubiquitous, although varied: Some things partake only superficially or nebulously, like a feeling (at least it has some name and existence), but others deeply and complexly, like physics.</p>

   <p>That logical structure is the underlying realm of software architecture. <b>Its focus is the region between vague and determinate, and its activity is to crystallise something for practical use</b>, by means of software engineering. (The same underlying realm also belongs to software engineering, but its purview is the clear and determinate, and its task is to implement architecture.) <b>Software architecture works to see and define useful new arrangements and expressions of logical structures.</b> For example: the newsgroup/forum, the Wiki, the FPS game, music recommending/tracking, the windowing GUI.</p>

   <p>With such an extensive domain, software architecture potentially has many kinds and specialisms. And also a variety of levels. Some will diverge, like building architecture and product design have for physical objects.</p>

   <p>Its prospect of development is also large, ultimately open-ended, owing to its main dependencies: There is continuing enlargement of engineering capability, and an inexhaustible request, in human behaviour, for novel variations of uses for it.</p>
