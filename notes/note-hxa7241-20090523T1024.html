   <p>Software engineering has veered a little off on a tangent. Its priorities have become unbalanced. Or at least the perception has.</p>

   <p>What is software design? &ndash; modularisation, class relationships, etc. &ndash; the structure of the code. This would be the normal view. And also accords with: Swebok 2004, 3-1 p51; and IEEE 610.12-1990.</p>

   <p>This is unsound. If you asked a civil/structural engineer about the design of a building, and they talked only about the style of diagrams and presentation of equations used, you would think there was something wrong: What about the resultant forces? the resilience to conditions? . . . what about the actual <i>function</i> of the building &ndash; how it stays standing-up and working?</p>

   <p>Engineering is about the functionality of what is produced, foremost. What helped the engineer design it is a side issue. The structure of internal representations &ndash; the code &ndash; has some value, but it is not essential: because it is only to serve the engineering process, it does not constitute the product. As an engineering kind of task, software design is <i>really</i> about storing data, moving data, and processing data. That is the functionality it creates, that is its core.</p>

   <p>How valuable is representational structure? At a worst it could have a severe indirect effect: much less product functionality would be developable with available effort. But the opposite is different: products have &lsquo;essential complexity&rsquo; that cannot be short-cut by refinement of tools &ndash; only re-use can help substantially. Complaints and wishes about languages etc. are figments. They arise because, unlike something physical, software lacks a defined tangibility to show the objective limits of its medium.</p>

   <p>Software engineering should devote <i>some</i> attention to the representation structure, but it should not become a self-indulgence.</p>
