   <p><b>It is good to think of software engineering as <i>&lsquo;the design of structures in a special abstract material&rsquo;</i>.</b></p>

   <p>The idea of software having or being a &lsquo;material&rsquo; is somewhat unconsciously appreciated, but is not prominent enough. Some casual Philosophy of Engineering can help: it attempts to clarify and point thought in the right directions.</p>

   <p>A material needs: to have objective properties, to be complex or sufficiently interesting, and to be usefully applicable. These are true of software, they only lack an obvious coherent &lsquo;body&rsquo; &ndash; software is so abstract and intangible it disappears behind its secondary factors of developer skill and organisational process.</p>

   <p>Software engineering is most essentially about usefully processing data within available computational resources of time and space. These are the defining elements: data and algorithms. On them are built accuracy, reliability, security, etc.. Evolvability is important, but it is a matter of representation not the structure itself, so it is dependent on the essentials.</p>

   <p>On this basis, software material is analogous to physical material in other engineerings: objective, logical, quantifiable, practical, useful &ndash; and the foundation. And software material has, like physical material, similar general characteristics:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>The material is objective and determinate &ndash; like mathematics it can produce logically provable, and measurable practically applicable, knowledge.</li>
      <li>The material has a range of regularity &ndash; it permits precise knowledge, as well as supporting rougher yet still reliable guides (as for craft)</li>
      <li>The material has certain properties, constraints, limitations &ndash; a &lsquo;grain&rsquo; that makes some structures work better than others, and some manipulations easier than others, and regulates the work activity itself.</li>
      <li>Structures can be substantially expressed in code etc. &ndash; though they are limited expressions, not covering all implications.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>With this model, doing software engineering is about knowing the material and working the material &ndash; it is designing structures, in the material, for useful ends. Improving software engineering is about improving theoretical and practical understanding of the material &ndash; and co-ordinating that with other activity. Everything specific to software, and adjacent to it, can be referred to, or fits around, the <i>material</i>.</p>
