   <p><b>Good engineering design rests essentially on good knowledge &ndash; not prediction</b></p>

   <p>To design for future modifiability is taken for granted in software development. But this superficially simple intent hides an implicitly misleading contradiction. Examining the elements &ndash; the meaning of design, and the character of software &ndash; shows why.</p>

   <p>On one hand, engineering design is essentially about working with known information: known by theoretical understanding, and known by as-needed experimentation. This is what makes it so effective. On the other hand, one of the core virtues of software is its underlying adabtability: bits are always open to change. This is what makes it resilient to the future &ndash; that is, to the unknown. These two sides conflict.</p>

   <p>You cannot <i>design</i> for the <i>unknown</i>. You cannot systematise and abstract over an unspecified, unbounded region. To try to design for future modifiability is a contradiction: it means design is dominated by the unknown, by lack of information &ndash; it can never work well, design becomes a problem that is insoluble.</p>

   <p>Design should look backward not forward. It should put together available components to meet intended requirements &ndash; doing the best job with information known now. Then later, when new conditions and needs arise, the design can be re-done to fit them &ndash; the new conditions become known information, and design can work with them properly.</p>

   <p>Any predictive, anticipatory, design must be based on good theoretical understanding. There must be sound reason to expect particular conditions, and a clear enough picture to make good judgements. Otherwise, such prediction is not known information, neither by understanding nor experiment, and so would weaken design.</p>

   <p><i>Design for what you know.</i></p>
