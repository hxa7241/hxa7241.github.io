   <h5>Code style is open to the same criticism as software patterns &ndash; they are indicative of a lack &ndash; but they may also be unavoidable</h5>

   <p>There is an argument that rejects patterns as valuable: patterns are said to be simply deficiencies in the programming language &ndash; if the language has the right features, patterns disappear.</p>

   <p>Coding style looks very much the same. Recommended &lsquo;good style&rsquo; of coding is truly just avoiding weakness in the form of the language. If the language had the right structure, &lsquo;good style&rsquo; would be unnecessary. This applies at all levels, from brace alignment to what should go in classes and packages.</p>

   <p>In fact, code style seems worse than patterns. Patterns are carefully structured and semi-formalised. They are like early prototypes of language structures. They have some determinate form. But code style seems to have a substantial core of whim and what looks &lsquo;nice&rsquo;. Much of it is actually <i>not</i>-programming &ndash; it does not properly belong in the subject of programming.</p>

   <p>The very essence of communication is that something is agreed upon. If there are code &lsquo;styles&rsquo;, that means there are various choices for expressing the same structures. But this is the exact opposite of communication. It is a situation where we have not decided what we should do or what things mean.</p>

   <p>(At least Python has one good example to follow. It took the way everyone indents &ndash; the way it makes sense to indent &ndash; and made it a <i>rule</i> of the language.)</p>

   <p>If something is good and the right way to code &ndash; if there is an approved &lsquo;style&rsquo; &ndash; make it a rule of the language. And if the language allows variation in a way of doing something, it should be there to express real logical structure. The aim should be a &lsquo;style&rsquo;-less language &ndash; the only &lsquo;styles&rsquo; are the structures of the language.</p>

   <p>But the defense of code styles could be the same as for patterns: styles are prototypical, potential forms. It is impossible to design a language &lsquo;correctly&rsquo; in one go; it needs feedback from use (like any other kind of design). The implication is perhaps the need for better ways to iterate language design . . .</p>

   <p>(But should we really have various fanciful, poetic &lsquo;style guides&rsquo;? &ndash; that is not programming, it is just a distraction.)</p>
