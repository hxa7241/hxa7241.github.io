   <h3>1</h3>

   <p>There is a deep structural opposition between the internet and the corporate/commercial model of the last 200 years since the industrial revolution. With the internet, the essence is connection: in all shapes and directions. With the corporation, the essence is centralisation: broadcast product one way, concentrate money the other way.</p>

   <p>The &lsquo;conical&rsquo; communication structure of the corporation can exist in the network structure of the internet, but the more cone-like it is, the less network-like it is. And because the cone is a sub-type of network structure, it requires extra effort to maintain stability, whereas general interconnection is built in to the fabric.</p>

   <p>And there is a another deep contradiction. The traditional commercial model works by mass production. It is not craft: working by individual skill. It is manufacturing: working by automation. But in the digital world, the very things that are automatable and hence scalable, are the very things that can be trivially copied and owned by anyone.</p>

   <p>What corporations depend on to exist is no longer worth anything, and what is worth something cannot support corporations.</p>


   <h3>2</h3>

   <p>But what was most valuable in the industrial model was not essential to the conical shape &ndash; the broadcast product and concentrated ownership (they are just commended by those who benefited most from them). It was the systems of cooperation. </p>

   <p>The &lsquo;modules&rsquo; of organisation of industrial corporate commerce have to be extracted from their conical/hierarchical structure and adjusted and replanted in the graph/network structure.</p>

   <p>We have somewhat made a digital structure for people as consumers &ndash; online retail and payment. People as <i>producers</i> needs to be &lsquo;digitised&rsquo; too. We have some examples in Wikipedia and GNU/Linux; we need more, similar, exploration and development.</p>
