   <h5>What, as a discipline, is software engineering trying to do? &ndash; One could begin to answer that its purpose is to be an optimal intermediary between requirement and material: a tool that goes where you point it, and shows you where it is pointing.</h5>


   <p>Software engineering's aim is to reflect the human fluidity of seeing things in new ways with a fluidity in changing software structure. We want software to keep up with our imagination.</p>

   <p>It is not, really, exactly, about better means of abstraction, but more like better means of <i>changing</i> abstractions. Half of the core reason why we like software is because it is easily changeable, and so half of the core value in software engineering is &ndash; or should be &ndash; to realise that virtue. One could say <i>changing</i> is a more generalised kind of <i>creating</i>.</p>

   <p>We like software because it can reflect this &ndash; software engineering tries to keep close to what we want do.</p>

      <p>&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>

   <p>Software engineering aims at clarification and fluidity of development.</p>

   <p>This is software engineering separated out as <i>facilitation</i>: the requirements are given, and the material is given (the limits and possibilities of computation as elucidated by computer science) &ndash; software engineering is left between as the systematic activity to join these together.</p>

   <p>The best it can do, then, is more fluidly construct what we think we want, and more clearly show what we have actually built. Think of software engineering as a very broad kind of tool. Its purpose is to be a tool that goes easily where you point it and shows you clearly where it is pointing &ndash; it lets you make what you want, and shows you what you are making.</p>

   <p>But this is just the essence of software; it is what software does anyway. Software engineering aims at clarity and fluidity because these are what software essentially and distinctively is about. A bit is precisely 0 or 1, and easily changeable between them. Software <i>is</i> clarity and fluidity.</p>

   <p>This is a derivation of the aim of software engineering from the other side &ndash; the material, not the requirements. It tries to keep us close to what software <i>is</i>.</p>

      <p>&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>

   <p>All engineering is fundamentally about this joining of <i>requirement</i> with <i>possibility</i>, as Vitruvius wrote:</p>

   <blockquote>
      <p>In architecture [particularly engineering in today's sense], as in other arts, two considerations must be constantly kept in view; namely, the intention, and the matter used to express that intention: but the intention is founded on a conviction that the matter wrought will fully suit the purpose;</p>
   </blockquote>

   <p>&ndash; ‘De Architectura’; Vitruvius; 25 BCE. &ndash; Book 1, Chapter 1, section 3.</p>
