   <p>To be informative requires saying something that could be wrong (if you do not have to think whether you are making a good or correct assertion, such an assertion has practically no meaning). And to do this in an interesting way requires statements/assertions with sufficiently rich structure.</p>

   <p>A rating must rate some <i>thing</i>. It must represent, or measure, an at least semi-defined objective thing. Rating should produce data, and if there is no definition &ndash; no <i>abstraction</i> &ndash; at all, there is no data.</p>

   <p>The easy-to-measure things can be done automatically, with sensors or algorithms etc.. The harder things must be left to humans. But the difference in harder things is not having <i>no</i> structure &ndash; of being entirely irrational, aesthetic, etc. &ndash; it is being <i>semi</i>-structured. The difference is merely in what is currently technically automatable.</p>

   <p>And it appears that Google not only understands this, but is somewhat ahead: they have been developing a sophisticated system based on complex analysis, as an extension to their +1 button. &lsquo;Project Argand&rsquo; (as it is known internally) is almost ready to go live, as <a href="http://www.hxa.name/other/google-plus-i-button/"><b>the Google +i button</b></a>.</p>
