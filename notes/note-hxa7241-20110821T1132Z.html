   <h5>The theoretical &lsquo;ideology&rsquo; of software engineering seems to be logical, mathematical &ndash; this is how we implicitly think of software, that is what computer science leads us toward. But is this a little misleading?</h5>


   <p>Software is essentially constructional, synthetic. This means it is crucially about transformation. Software engineering is not so much about <i>defining a formulation</i>, as <i>building it</i>, that is, organising incremental changes.</p>

   <p>Mathematics wants to produce timeless final artifacts, permanent truths. But software is not built to be a final statement, a logical foundation; it is built for human intentions. Software is for building changing artifacts. Mathematics seeks truth, software seeks usefulness.</p>

   <p>The mathematical ideology of software makes changes seem a bit awkward, a burden, a fault. But really change is what software &ndash; as the production of actual useful artifacts &ndash; essentially is and should be built on.</p>

   <p>Change is what we spend time doing with code. Change is something we <i>want</i> to do &ndash; to make new things. And change is something software is uniquely capable of. Yet we do not seem to address it properly. We do not have a systematic, formalised, understandable way of doing it. This looks like a big gap in software engineering.</p>
