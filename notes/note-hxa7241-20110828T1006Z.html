   <h5>Is it possible to have a software equivalent to the <a href="http://longnow.org/">&lsquo;Long Now&rsquo;</a> project? Can we imagine a software system that would last for 10000 years? (or even just 1000) This means both running and adapting/reusing &ndash; both of the two fundamental aspects of software.</h5>


   <p>We do not know very well how to build enduring systems, self-supporting systems.</p>

   <p>Some think of Lisp as being a language for the next thousand years, could that actually be possible? But that is not really quite a software system: it is more like culture. It is not independently viable.</p>

   <p>But software <i>is</i> partly culture. At its best, it is a symbiosis of human and machine. It not a separate object but diffused amongst us like a mycelial structure. It is both independent and dependent.</p>

   <p>Perhaps the internet is the best we have done (Alan Kay).</p>

      <p>~ ~ ~</p>

   <p>Of course, we already have an example: DNA systems. But DNA systems are evolution not machine, not engineering.</p>

   <p>This leads to a comparison of evolution and engineering: engineering is good for deliberate building for intended purposes, and evolution is good for automatic building for unknown circumstances.</p>

   <p>What is needed is a combination. How to make an evolutionary system that is fixed to a particular purpose? Evolution is only fixed to reproduction. So the reproduction would have to be made to depend on the intended aim: parts that follow the aim are helped to reproduce.</p>

   <p>Is it possible to maintain information enduringly? Something representing the intention must be totally permanent or self-renewing. But a fixed intent limits evolution: it implicitly limits evolution's scope of response to circumstances. That means it weakens the robustness of its reproduction &ndash; its most fundamental essence.</p>

      <p>Engineering and evolution are antagonistic. The best that could be done is to do the right amount of each: for engineering, predict the environment, and your working materials, and design accordingly; for evolution, allow it freedom to handle the rest that is unknown.</p>

      <p>~ ~ ~</p>

   <p>The fault with some software is to try to solve all the problems and realise all the visions, and in one single super-system. This cannot be the way to create &lsquo;big&rsquo; software. Everything is too interdependent and controlled.</p>

   <p>A good architectural form <i>co-operates</i> with users. It does not constrain them or do everything for them, it serves them while also allowing them freedom. And software has <i>two</i> kinds of users, the second is other software makers. They also need that freedom. The ultimate architectural form for software is co-operative and emergent.</p>

   <p>Grand-scale software must be designed as much by <i>not</i> designing: by not specifying too much, by not controlling everything. It is as much about what is left out.</p>

      <p>~ ~ ~</p>

      <p>So what would be a good project for a &lsquo;Long Now&rsquo; of software? Maybe a kind of DNA engineering framework, or perhaps more like a DNA unix &ndash; a basic software infrastructure for using DNA systems to build all manner of things &ndash; <a href="http://biobricks.org/">BioBricks</a> and further . . .</p>
