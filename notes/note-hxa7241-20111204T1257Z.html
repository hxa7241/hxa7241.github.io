   <h5>This is a prompt to think differently about information, IP, and their economic arrangement.</h5>


   <p>Governmental persons sometimes talk of how we are entering a new kind of post-industrial age: an information economy, an economy dominated by knowledge work and production. Well, we already have an exemplar, leading the way &ndash; software. But it says something they do not want to hear &ndash; or at least their corporate sponsors do not.</p>

   <p>The big lesson of software production seems to be: get rid of IP copy-restriction. The biggest way to increase production is not by giving producers more money &ndash; as the monopoly mechanism of IP is built to do. Money is comparatively weak. The biggest way to increase production is by sharing products &ndash; information thrives on itself &ndash; and that is the opposite of IP.</p>

   <p>That is the funny thing. IP really only works with products that are substantially <i>non</i>-informational. IP is actually a form of old material industry &ndash; it is not post-industrial at all. When you have an economy that really <i>is</i> purely informational, IP does not make sense. IP is the <i>obstruction</i> to an information-economy.</p>

   <p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

   <p>IP does exactly the opposite of what you want in an information economy. Here are three ways to begin to see that:</p>


   <h3>1</h3>

   <p>As information technology improves, the cost of IP grows. And since that technology has exploded in power, the cost of IP has consequently grown enormously too.</p>

   <p>When information was in paper books, it was difficult to copy. Copyright did not really restrict copying since people could not make copies anyway. But now information is digital the <i>real cost</i> of copying is practically zero. That means the <i>artificial restrictions</i> of copyright stops people realising a large benefit that would otherwise be available.</p>

   <p>The gain that technology offers is exactly what IP blocks.</p>


   <h3>2</h3>

   <p>The most vital ingredient in production of new information seems most likely not extra monetary incentive, but <i>other</i> information. The more complex the product, the more concentrated the accumulation of other informational inputs.</p>

   <p>And information has a special magic that money does not: its value can be endlessly multiplied. A single amount of money can only pay for one piece of information production. But through copying, a single amount of information can contribute to an unlimited number of pieces of information production.</p>

   <p>IP obstructs this most important ingredient of production and its immense leverage.</p>


   <h3>3</h3>

   <p>Economic growth means more productivity; that is, not that we simply make more, but that we can have more good stuff for less cost or input.</p>

   <p>The greatest source of that is the copyability of information. Copies give the whole value of the product, but for none of the cost: increasing copying is virtually ideal growth. Every new copy used adds the full value of the product into the economy at near zero cost.</p>

   <p>An efficient economy would maximise copying, and a growing one drive towards that. An IP economy restricts it.</p>

   <p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

   <p>It could be responded that the standard economic model of IP accommodates all this: it is a trade-off of production and access, so we just need to find the optimal balance. But information is too important to be compromised into an unnecessary trade-off. It is the essence of information to be copied &ndash; that is what it means. <b>Wanting to have information copied less is like wanting wheels to be less round.</b> We should start viewing things differently and developing new, less information-obstructive, economic arrangements.</p>
