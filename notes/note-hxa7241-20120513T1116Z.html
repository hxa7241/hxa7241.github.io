   </blockquote>

   <p>This appears to be a peculiarly intriguing question. It is about something apparently very simple, yet it seems somehow profound.</p>

   <p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

   <p>Initially, one might say:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>One-dimensionality is simplest.</li>
      <li>The sequence maps to time.</li>
      <li>Grouping is also a common feature: codons, words, bytes.</li>
      <li>A string of digits is a product-type (the string) of sum-types (the digits).</li>
      <li>The digits are abstract.</li>
      <li>Information works by &lsquo;reference&rsquo; in some sense . . . so it does not need to represent structure directly . . . a single symbol can control a whole machinery.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>There a various things to observe and note, but none individually amount to a satisfying answer. The last, though, is the main lead.</p>

   <p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

   <p>Information is like data-structure: the definition, the meaning of it is really in what is <i>done</i> with it. Information <i>is</i> information &ndash; it has the features it has &ndash; because it is <i>computed</i> with. When we say &lsquo;information&rsquo; we are really saying, in a shortened form, &lsquo;the thing we do computation with&rsquo;.</p>

   <p>So what is computation? This must be left for another note, but computation seems fundamentally about time, and action, and causality, and change (it is just a particular way of using those elements). Computation is action, and that must take place in time. But it is also completely general, so it cannot fix any other structure.</p>

   <p>Information drives computation. So information is really a (temporal) sequence of instructions that are entirely general: so there cannot be any structure beside time, because that would be a constraint and so no longer general.</p>

   <p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

   <p>(Besides just seeing the relevant facts and features, any profundity is a false impression. It is like sensing a profundity in asking what makes a table table-like &ndash; what is the <i>essence</i> that makes it a table? Ultimately, information (and computation) is <i>like</i> information simply because that is what it <i>is</i>.)</p>
