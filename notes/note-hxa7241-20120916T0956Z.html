   <p>Including normal kinds of credit/acknowledgement in an info-good is not a very sensible way to use information. This is because of two features of credit.</p>

   <p>Credit is really a network property/feature. Nothing is really &lsquo;created&rsquo; by a single creator, there is no special start or end point for information. &lsquo;Creation&rsquo; is really a pedigree/family-tree: an extended region of the network. To enquire of the &lsquo;creator&rsquo; is really a simplified convention of a more general kind of query.</p>

   <p>And credit is a kind of metadata and so suffers from its problems: it can lie, or be wrong, or be absent. The solution is to focus away from the credit, and primarily on the subjects of the metadata, the info-goods themselves, and particularly in this case their relation to others</p>

   <p>So this suggests that the better form is <i>not</i> to include credit, but to <b>decouple credit from info-good</b>. Have all info-goods go about unadorned, simply as they are. And when you want to know a provenance, get a (fuzzy) hash of the thing and put it into some index/search and find out <i>various open-ended</i> things about it. If a cartoon has a similar drawing style as another previous one, or a piece of music quotes another, those influences and contributions are just as noteworthy as the ostensible notion of &lsquo;the creator&rsquo; and can just as easily be shown. These are wider network-relational features of the goods that embedded credit cannot give but decoupled credit/information can.</p>

   <p>There are already some inchoate examples of this when viewed from this perspective: musicbrainz, wikipedia, web-search all provide various post hoc distributed info (especially musicbrainz, which uses the CD disc-ID hash) &ndash; you have a thing, then you look-up more about it elsewhere.</p>

   <p>So this approach of decoupling description and associating by hash is not unknown, but perhaps needs to be more consciously pursued as the right basic way.</p>
