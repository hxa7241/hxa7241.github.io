   <h5>The &lsquo;flatness&rsquo; of the internet just makes it even more subject to be shaped by the inevitable non-flatness of our uses of it.</h5>


   <div class="part" id="part0">
   <h4>0: Introduction: the myth and its wrongness</h4>

   <p>In the early years of the internet a vague beguiling myth emerged of a new social order. The network would dissolve hierarchy and bring a more democratic structure, organised from the interconnections between people &ndash; a <i>decentralised</i> world.</p>

   <p>But it was all wrong &ndash; the internet has made power even more concentrated than before. And no-one seems to know why, or quite what to do. How can this be? Could it have been predicted? Perhaps: here is a quick explanation.</p>

   </div>


   <div class="part" id="part1">
   <h4>1: The internet is structurally unbiased</h4>

   <p>The internet is <i>implemented</i> in a decentralised/flat/distributed/network/peer structure, but does that mean its <i>use</i> will be too? No. The abstraction it presents for use is structureless: it merely enables any point to connect to any other.</p>

   <p>Consequently the internet does not induce a distributed/flat network structure in its uses, nor in fact any kind of structure. It equally supports any kind &ndash; which might include even completely, singly, centralised.</p>

   </div>


   <div class="part" id="part2">
   <h4>2: The gain of informational-leverage means centralisation</h4>

   <p>The basic structure of the internet does not favour or disfavour centralisation, but something else does &ndash; the uses we choose for it.</p>

   <p>The power of information is in its &lsquo;informational-leverage&rsquo;: creating it costs something, but copying it is near unlimited and free, and each copy yields the full value of the original.</p>

   <p>Each piece of information is a centralisation of the leveraged gain of its many copies, and so the desire for such gain pushes toward creating such centralisations.</p>

   </div>


   <div class="part" id="part3">
   <h4>3: The internet increases the range of desired structures</h4>

   <p>The internet adds more nodes/people/etc to connect to each other, and better connections between them; by this it increases the range, scale, and kinds of possible informational structure.</p>

   <p>Since the internet can provide more of any structure, and there is a drive to centralisation, this means more instances, kinds, and scales of centralisation &ndash; more centralisation, and bigger centralisation.</p>

   </div>


   <div class="part" id="part4">
   <h4>4: Conclusion: a matter of proper control</h4>

   <p>The internet is a gargantuan and anfractuous engine, and we drive it disorganisedly toward centralisation. But this is not truly, entirely a bad thing after all. Centralisations are good when done well.</p>

   <p>The problems of cooperation are those of concentration, filtering, abstraction, of information. Being for or against de/centralisation per-se misses the point. Cooperation <i>is</i> centralisation. The right centralisations, because of the gains of informational-leverage, are tremendously valuable, but which centralisations shall we have? And how and where? The important question is more like: how are they controllable by individual and rational feedback.</p>
