   <h5>Why have objects? They are &lsquo;naturally arising&rsquo;: components are necessary, callbacks are valuable, and grouping them is good &ndash; and there is an object.</h5>


   <div class="part" id="part0">
      <p>Instead of seeing OO as something devised, a way of doing things that was designed, or otherwise deliberate, try looking at OO as antiteleological &ndash; as just one of the natural forms that arises from the &lsquo;grain&rsquo; of the material of software, and whose usefulness is rather by happenstance.</p>

      <p>The argument proceeds thus:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Components naturally arise &ndash; in building and in knowledge.</li>
         <li>Callbacks naturally arise &ndash; as a shortcut to passing actual code.</li>
         <li>Groupings naturally arise &ndash; by offering a way to components.</li>
         <li>Conclusion &ndash; do not overdo it.</li>
      </ul>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="part1">
      <h4>Components naturally arise</h4>

      <p>Things must be broken into pieces &ndash; components &ndash; for building to be possible at all. Otherwise, everything would have to be made as a monolithic whole, completely from scratch each time, with no knowledge ever reused.</p>

      <p>And with components necessarily comes: 1, interfaces between components; and 2, parameterisation of those interfaces. Parameterisation is really what gives the reusability: with none, a component could only fit in a single place &ndash; it would not really be a component, it would still be part of a monolith and not really separate. The range of the parameters allows the component to fit in multiple places.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="part2">
      <h4>Callbacks naturally arise</h4>

      <p>The maximal limit/&lsquo;extent&rsquo; of a component interface is, in a way, Turing-completeness &ndash; the component being parameterised by a full programming language. Rather than the component being configured with a few &lsquo;switches&rsquo; or other values, it is controlled with a language that has no computational limit.</p>

      <p>But when both component and client run in the same context, in the same form, there is a shortcut: callbacks. Instead of an interface taking source-code text to parse and interpret, or even ready-compiled code to execute, it can take not code but merely a pointer to it. The component is still parameterised by general code, but packaged in a different way &ndash; by reference really.</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="part3">
      <h4>Groupings naturally arise</h4>

      <p>Software creators seek grouping because it is a kind of inchoate component: finding a commonality, an aspect of simplification, is a step toward finding something understandable and buildable, as noted above.</p>

      <p>The salient way of grouping callback procedures is on their shared parameters. And that will tend to boil down to a single one that represents what is common &ndash; any that are shared can be factored into one.</p>

      <p>So we end up with a set of callback procedures grouped around a shared datastructure ... and there is an object !</p>
   </div>


   <div class="part" id="part4">
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>

      <p>Does this mean OO is excellent, right, and obligatory? No. It is one structure that has a place.</p>
   </div>
