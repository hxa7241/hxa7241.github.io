   <h5 id="p0">Bitcoin is like a steam-powered horseshoe, or an electronic typewriter: it is a contrafunctory overlap of two different eras. It distracts from inventing new info-tech and solving manifest problems.</h5>

   <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

   <p id="p1">Bitcoin/blockchain/etc is new tech stuck in an old mindset facing old problems &ndash; digitising money and contract. In an informational world we should take the opportunity to rethink the forms of our interactions. But nothing in the elements of blockchain fosters new coherent/collective behaviour, because blockchain is at base individual-focused.</p>

   <p id="p2">What are crypto-ledgers fundamentally? They are about unique/inimitable data-source identity (that is what is produced by their implementation: virtually-unique token + one-way function). This makes an instant, very simple consensus: if there is only one of something it is impossible, objectively, for it not to be agreed on. (What is agreement? Not merely sameness: it must have some objective anchor, or how do you know if you <i>are</i> agreeing?). Crypto-ledgers do not create new kinds of consensus, only a new form of record of any consensus. They instigate no new patterns.</p>

   <p id="p3">The main info problem of cooperation is creating new kinds of rules/patterns &ndash; constraints on action (&ndash; and today, automations of them). Yet there seems nothing in crypto-ledgers that automates finding of, or induces following of, new common/shared structures. Because they perfom no abstraction: no gathering or filtering or merging of info; nor do they embody any new single fixed such abstraction. To support a shared structure, you need to coalesce info, and crypto-ledgers do not.</p>

   <p id="p4">Reinventing money and contracts is socio-technological regress, it has all been done long ago. And the claims made of its &lsquo;decentralisation&rsquo;? &ndash; they are only a confusion of implementation with usage. The largest force of centralisation in practice is money and property, because property and money work by concentrating control in human decision. Bitcoin/blockchain etc is just a reinforcement, a digital re-invigoration, of all that &ndash; making it run on distributed computers is immaterial to the consequence at large.</p>

   <p id="p5">So put aside crypto-ledger stuff ... <b>How should we shape our local transactions with more kinds of global information? Make tech for <i>that</i>!</b></p>
